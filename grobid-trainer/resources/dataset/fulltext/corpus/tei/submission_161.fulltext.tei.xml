			<p>A variety of quantum phases due to the strong interlayer electronic correlations were predicted in electron multi-<lb/>layers at the filling factor ν = 1<ref type="biblio">[1]</ref>. As was demonstrated, depending on the ratio d/l B , where d is the interlayer<lb/> separation and l B is the magnetic length, different ground states may be realized. Here we report on observation<lb/> of the magnetic field driven quantum phase transitions in<lb/> weakly coupled, intentionally disordered multiple<lb/> quantum wells. The structure studied here consists of a<lb/> 240 nm wide AlGaAs parabolic well modulated by a<lb/> sequence of ten quantum wells with random widths<lb/> separated by 4.2 nm barriers. The largest (34 nm) GaAs<lb/> well (QW 0 ) is in the center of the parabolic well. The<lb/> electron concentration in the parabolic well was 3.7x10 11<lb/> cm -2 and mobility 2x10 5 cm 2 /Vs. According to the<lb/> calculations eight wells are occupied. They emit eight<lb/> corresponding photoluminescence (PL) lines. At the<lb/> magnetic field B=1.5T these wells reveal the miniband<lb/> quantum Hall (QH) state with the total filling factor ν SL =<lb/> 1. At B=3T another QH state with the filling factor ν SL =<lb/> 0.5 emerges. The spin polarizations of both these QH<lb/> states, as determined by PL measurements, are almost<lb/> 100%. We attribute the state found at B=3T to the paired<lb/> dimer state with the total filling factor ν D = 1 suggested<lb/> in the QH multiple wells as the ground state with the<lb/> lowest energy <ref type="biblio">[2]</ref>. The peaks of the electron spin<lb/> polarization manifest to the skyrmion origin of the<lb/> respective quantum Hall states. With further increase of<lb/> the magnetic field, at B=6T the slope of the Hall<lb/> resistance increases. Our recent magnetoresistance<lb/> experiments on this sample have shown that in this case<lb/> the magnetic field induces a quantum transition<lb/> separating two phases with different distributions of the<lb/> electron density over the random wells Ref.<ref type="biblio">[3]</ref>. In the<lb/> high-field phase, the electrons in the lateral AlGaAs<lb/> wells which form a collective skyrmion state are pinned<lb/> at the random potential. While, the central GaAs well<lb/> completely determines the in-plane magneto-resistance<lb/> of the sample revealing well developed FQH states. The<lb/> integrated intensities of the PL lines from the central well<lb/> (QW 0 ) and from the neighboring wells (QW -1 and QW 2 ), associated with their occupations, directly demonstrate<lb/> the magnetic field driven re-distribution of the electrons: with increasing magnetic field the electrons move from<lb/> the neighboring wells to the central well. We show that the miniband and dimer QH states vanish with<lb/> increasing interlayer disorder. While, no significant effect of the disorder was observed on the single-layer high-<lb/>field QH states.<lb/></p>
