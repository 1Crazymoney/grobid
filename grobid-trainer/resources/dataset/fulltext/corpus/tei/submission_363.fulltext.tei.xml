			<front>COHERENCE PROPERTIES OF QUANTUM DOT RESONANCE<lb/> FLUORESCENCE<lb/> Clemens Matthiesen 1 , Peter Humphreys 1 , Nick Vamivakas 1 , M. Atatüre 1<lb/> 1 Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge, JJ Thomson Ave, Cambridge CB30HE, UK<lb/></front>

			<p>Resonance fluorescence has proven to be a useful technique for studying self-assembled quantum dot<lb/> spin dynamics <ref type="biblio">[1,2]</ref>, as well as for the demonstration of single-shot spin readout <ref type="biblio">[3]</ref>. However, one important<lb/> advantage of resonance fluorescence is the direct access to the generated photons, which also carry quantum dot<lb/> spin state information. Key challenges for resonance fluorescence in quantum information processing are<lb/> currently laser background suppression and optical coherence. In this work we present progress in overcoming<lb/> these challenges: In particular, we show that our signal to background ratio reaches approximately 1000:1 while<lb/> maintaining an overall photon collection efficiency of 1%. These results suggest that we are now in the regime<lb/> where the requirements for fault-tolerant quantum error correction could be satisfied. Further, we report field-<lb/>correlation measurements on resonance fluorescence photons generated in the weak (0.2 times saturation) and<lb/> the strong (4000 times saturation) excitation regime. <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> presents an exemplary result for excitation<lb/> approximately 200 times the saturation value. These measurements reveal explicitly that the photon coherence is<lb/> reduced as a function of excitation Rabi frequency in a similar nature to recent results employing ultrafast pulses<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[4]</ref>. Despite the reduction of single photon coherence time to around 400 picoseconds for the highest excitation,<lb/> we still observe coherent rotations up to 22π.<lb/></p>
