			<front>LONG-TIME PHOTOLUMINESCENCE KINETICS IN QUANTUM<lb/> DOTS<lb/> K. Kr√°l *<lb/> Institute of Physics, Academy of Sciences of Czech Republic, v.v.i., Na Slovance 2, 18221 Prague 8<lb/> Czech Republic<lb/></front>

			<p>One of the remarkable experimental characteristics of the so called blinking of the quantum dots is<lb/> their power law distribution of the lengths of the on (off) periods during which the photoluminescence is on<lb/> (off). The power law time characteristics do not seem to be rare in the zero-dimensional systems. In the present<lb/> theoretical work we want to pay attention to still another significant effect, namely to the experimentally<lb/> observed power-law time-dependence of the decay of photoluminescence of a quantum dot sample after<lb/> excitation by a laser pulse. The luminescence response of certain quantum dot systems to a short laser pulse has<lb/> been experimentally found to be a slow process, developing in time as a power-law dependence, in contrast to<lb/> the perhaps usually expected exponential decay. We bring arguments in favor of the interpretation that the<lb/> power-law decay can be basically a single-dot property connected closely to the electron-LO-phonon<lb/> interaction. This interaction is included in a degree expressing a non-adiabatic influence of the atomic lattice<lb/> motion on the electrons inside the quantum dot. The properties of the system are analyzed numerically and<lb/> compared to experiments.<lb/></p>
