 </p><p> GENETICALLY MODIFIED YEAST SPECIES, AND FERMENTATION 
PROCESSES USING GENETICALLY MODIFIED YEAST 
This invention was made under contract no. DE-FC07-021D14349 with the United States Department of Energy. The United States Government has certain rights to this invention. </p><p> This application claims benefit of <bibl next="bibl182" type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">United States Provisional Application No. </bibl></p><p><bibl xml:id="bibl182" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">60/467, 727</bibl>, filed May 2,2003. </p><p> This invention relates to certain genetically modified yeast species. </p><p> Because of the gradual depletion of world-wide petroleum and natural gas feedstocks, a desire on the part of oil-importing nations to decrease their dependence on foreign sources of oil, and a desire to establish a more sustainable basis to the economy, much effort is being devoted to the production of fuels and organic chemicals and plastics from alternative feedstocks. Fermentation processes offer the possibility of producing a variety of fuels and chemicals from naturally-occurring sugar sources. For example, ethanol is produced in significant quantity by fermenting glucose, most typically glucose obtained by hydrolysing corn starch. A yeast species, Saccharomyces &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;cerevisiae,&lt;/RTI&gt; is a common biocatalyst for fermenting glucose to ethanol. </p><p> These sugars represent a relatively expensive carbon source. Biomass, i. e. plant matter hydrolysate, offers the possibility of being a particularly inexpensive source of carbon. Biomass consists mainly of cellulose and hemicellulose. Cellulose can be broken down into hexose sugars, typically glucose. Most yeasts, including S. &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;cerevisiae,&lt;/RTI&gt; metabolise hexose sugars quite efficiently. Hemicellulose, on the other hand, is rich in pentose sugars such as xylose, so efficient carbon utilization requires that these pentose sugars be metabolised as well. Very few yeast efficiently metabolize xylose to ethanol or other desirable fermentation products. So, in order to exploit the full economic potential offered by using biomass carbon sources, it is necessary to provide a biocatalyst that can efficiently convert xylose to desirable fermentation products. </p><p> Various bacteria are capable of metabolising xylose into fermentation products, but these generally produce a mixture of products, rather than a single predominant product as is usually desired. The common by-products are sometimes toxic to the bacteria. Even though certain bacteria have been metabolically engineered to perform homoethanolic fermentions, bacteria tend to perform poorly in </p><p>&lt;Desc/Clms Page number 2&gt;</p><p> the harsh environment of lignocellulosic hydrolysates, which are a common source of xylose-rich substrates. </p><p> Some yeast species such as S. cerevisiae are known to ferment hexose sugars predominantly into ethanol, rather than the mixtures of products typically produced by bacteria. Some yeasts have other characteristics that make them good candidates for various types of fermentation process, such as resistance to low pH environments, resistance to certain fermentation co-products such as acetic acid and furfural, and resistance to ethanol itself. </p><p> Most yeast species metabolise xylose (if at all) via a complex route, in which xylose is first reduced to xylitol via a xylose reductase (XR) enzyme. The xylitol is then oxidized to xylulose via a xylitol dehydrogenase &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;(XDH)&lt;/RTI&gt; enzyme. The xylulose is then phosphorylated via an XK enzyme. This pathway operates inefficiently in yeast species because it introduces a redox imbalance in the cell. The xylose-to-xylitol step uses NADH as a cofactor, whereas the xylitol-to-xylulose step uses NADPH as a cofactor. Other processes must operate to restore the redox imbalance within the cell. </p><p>This often means that the organism cannot grow anaerobically on xylose or other pentose sugar. </p><p> Nonetheless, attempts have been made to introduce exogenous XR and XDH genes into yeast species such as S. &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;cerevisiae&lt;/RTI&gt; in order to achieve conversion of xylose to ethanol. See, for example, <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">US Patent No. 5, &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;866,&lt;/RTI&gt; 382,</bibl> <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">WO 95/13362</bibl> and <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">WO 97/42307</bibl>. The engineered yeast did not produce ethanol efficiently. </p><p> Other organisms can isomerise xylose into xylulose and then phosphorylate the xylulose to xylulose 5-phosphate, which then is further metabolised through the cell's central carbon pathway. The isomerization is promoted by a catalytic enzyme, xylose isomerase (XI) and the phosphorylation is catalysed by a xylulokinase &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;(XK)&lt;/RTI&gt; enzyme. This pathway is common in bacteria, but relatively rare in eukaryotic species such as yeast. It does not create the redox imbalance created in the xylose-to- xylitol-to-xylulose pathway, and thus is in principle a more efficient anaerobic mechanism. An anaerobic fungus, Piromyces sp. E2 (ATCC 76762), is known to possess a gene that expresses an active XI enzyme. </p><p> However, no wild type or recombinant yeast species has had the capacity to efficiently produce desirable fermentation products from xylose or other pentose sugar feedstocks. An attempt to introduce the Piromyces sp. E2 XI gene into S. cerevisiae resulted in very slow growth on xylose and did not result in reported </p><p>&lt;Desc/Clms Page number 3&gt;</p><p> ethanol production.

plasmid. </p><p>Figure 40 is a diagram depicting the pCM48 plasmid. </p><p> The genetically modified yeast of the invention is made by performing certain genetic modifications to a host yeast cell. </p><p> A suitable host yeast cell contains at least one native gene that produces an active enzyme that is capable of catalyzing the conversion of D-xylose to xylitol. </p><p>These may be specific to the &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;xylose-yxylitol&lt;/RTI&gt; reduction, or may be non-specific (i. e., operate on a range of pentose sugars). Enzymes produced by such genes are variously referred to by EC number 1.1. 1.21, and formally as alditol: &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;NAD (P) &lt;/RTI&gt; 1- oxidoreductase). The enzyme encoded by such genes generally has the following activity: D-xylose + NAD (P) H = xylitol + NAD+ (i. e. it can use either NADPH or NADH as redox cofactors, or both). A gene expressing a xylose reductase enzyme is referred to herein as a"xylose reductase gene", or &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;an"XR&lt;/RTI&gt; gene". In some instances, specific XR genes are &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;designated"XYL1"genes&lt;/RTI&gt; herein. </p><p> The term"native"is used herein with respect to genetic materials (e. g. , a gene, promoter or terminator) that are found (apart from individual-to-individual mutations which do not affect its function) within the genome of the modified cells of that species of yeast. </p><p> A host yeast cell capable of converting D-xylose to xylitol will generally have the native ability to further convert xylitol to D-xylulose. This is generally accomplished by expressing a xylitol dehydrogenase (XDH) enzyme that is encoded by a gene referred to herein as xylitol dehydrogenase gene"or an"XDH gene". </p><p>Enzymes encoded by such genes are variously referred to by EC number 1.1. 1.9, commonly as xylitol dehydrogenase and systematically a xylitol : NAD+ 2- &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;oxidoreductase&lt;/RTI&gt; (D-xylulose-forming). These genes generally have the following activity: xylitol + NAD (P) + = D-xylulose + NAD (P) H (although NAD+ is by far the preferred substrate, some do use NADP+). Specific XDH genes are designated "XYL2"genes herein. A suitable host cell has one or more native genes that produce a functional aldose reductase or xylose reductase enzyme and a functional XDH enzyme. An enzyme &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;is"functional"within&lt;/RTI&gt; the context of this invention if it is capable of performing its usual or intended role. A gene &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;is"functional"within&lt;/RTI&gt; the context of this invention if it expresses a functional enzyme. </p><p>&lt;Desc/Clms Page number 6&gt;</p><p> Another suitable host yeast cell has the ability to transport xylose across its cell wall or membrane. </p><p> Another suitable host yeast cell is one that naturally grows on xylose, such as one having an active natural pathway from &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;xylulose-5-phosphate&lt;/RTI&gt; to glyceraldehyde-3- phosphate. In this invention, the pathway from xylulose-5-phosphate to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate is considered to be active if at least 10% of glucose-based sugars are metabolized by the wild type cell through the hexose monophosphate pathway. Preferably, at least 20, more preferably at least 30%, especially at least 40% of ribulose-5-phosphate is metabolised through this pathway. </p><p> Suitable host cells include, for example, yeast cells of the genera &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt; Kluyveromyces, Candida, Pichia, Hansenula, Trichosporon, Brettanomyces, &lt;/RTI&gt; Pachysolen and &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;Yamadazyma.&lt;/RTI&gt; Yeast species of particular interest include K. marxianus, K. &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;lactis,&lt;/RTI&gt; K thermotolerans, C. &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;sonorensis,&lt;/RTI&gt; C. methanosorbosa, C. diddensiae, C. parapsilosis, C. naeodendra, C. balnkii, C. entomophila, C. scehatae, &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;P.&lt;/RTI&gt; tannophilus and P. stipitis. K. marxianus, C. sonorensis, C. scehatae, Pachysolen tannophilus and &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;Pichia&lt;/RTI&gt; stipitis are examples of yeast cells that grow on xylose. They have a natural xylulose-5-phosphate to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate pathway, natural functional aldose and/or xylose reductase genes, active xylitol dehydrogenase genes, and natural ability to transport xylose through the cell wall or membrane. Preferred host cells include those of the species K. &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;marxianus, K lactis, K thermotolerans, &lt;/RTI&gt; C. sonorensis and C. methanosorbosa. </p><p> The host cell may contain genetic modifications other than those specifically described herein. For example, the host cell may be genetically modified to produce (or not produce) a particular type of fermentation product by further metabolizing xylulose-5-phosphate and/or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate. Specific examples of such modifications include the deletion or disruption of a native pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC) gene, and the insertion of exogenous genes such as an L-lactate dehydrogenase (L-LDH) or D-lactate dehydrogenase &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;(D-LDH)&lt;/RTI&gt; gene. Methods for making modifications of these types are described, for example, in <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">WO 99/14335</bibl>, <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">WO &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;00/71738,&lt;/RTI&gt;</bibl> <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">WO &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;02/42471,&lt;/RTI&gt;</bibl> <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">WO &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;03/102201,&lt;/RTI&gt;</bibl> <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">WO 03/102152</bibl> and <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">WO 03/049525</bibl>. These modifications may be present in the host cell prior to further modifying the host cell as described herein, or may be done simultaneously with or after such further modifications as described herein. </p><p>&lt;Desc/Clms Page number 7&gt;</p><p> Genetically modified yeast cells of certain aspects of the invention include a functional, exogenous xylose isomerase (XI) gene that is preferably integrated into the genome of the host cell. In this context, "exogenous"means (1) the XI gene is not native to the host cell, (2) the XI gene is native to the host cell, but the genome of the host cell has been modified to provide additional functional copies of the native XI gene, or (3) both (1) and (2). Examples of suitable XI genes include XI genes native to Piromyces species E2 (such as the Piromyces sp. E2 &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;xylA&lt;/RTI&gt; encoding gene sequence in Genbank (Assession &amp;num; AJ249909) ) and Cyllamyces &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;aberensis&lt;/RTI&gt; as well as those obtained from other anaerobic fungi. Nucleotide sequences for the Piromyces species E2 and Cyllamyces Aberensis XI genes are identified as SEQ. &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;ID.&lt;/RTI&gt; NOs. 58 and 151, respectively. Deduced amino acid sequences for proteins produced by these XI genes are identified as SEQ. ID. No. 59 and 152, respectively. A suitable bacterial XI gene is native to Bacteroides &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;thetaiotaomicron.&lt;/RTI&gt; The nucleotide sequence for this B. thetaiotamicron XI gene is identified as SEQ. ID. NO. 162. The deduced amino acid sequence for the enzyme produced by this gene is identified as SEQ. ID. NO. 163. </p><p>Suitable XI genes include those that are at least 60%, 80%, 90%, 95%, 98% or 99% homologous to SEQ. ID. NOs. 58 or 151. Suitable XI genes include those that encode for enzymes that are at least 60%, 80%, 90%, 95%, 98% or &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;99%&lt;/RTI&gt; homologous to SEQ. </p><p>ID. NOs. 59 or 152. Some suitable xylose isomerase genes are no greater than 95% or no greater than 90% homologous to SEQ. ID. NO. 58 or encode an enzyme that is no greater than 95% or no greater than 90% homologous to SEQ. ID. NO. 59. Other suitable xylose isomerase genes are bacterial xylose isomerase genes that are at least 60,80, 90,95, 98 or 99% homologous to SEQ. ID. NO. 162 and/or produce an enzyme that is at least 60,80, 90,95, 98 or 99% homologous to SEQ. ID. NO. 163. </p><p> Percent homology of amino acid sequences can conveniently computed using BLAST version 2.2. 1 software with default parameters. Sequences having an identities score and a positives score of at least XX%, using the BLAST version 2.2. 1 algorithm with default parameters are considered at least &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;XX%&lt;/RTI&gt; homologous. </p><p>Particularly suitable xylose isomerase genes include those that encode for an enzyme that has an identities score of at least 60%, compared with SEQ. ID. NO. 163, an identities score of less than 95%, compared with SEQ. ID. NO. 59, and a positives score of less than 97%, compared with SEQ. ID. NO. 59. </p><p> The exogenous XI gene is under the control of a promoter and a terminator, both of which are functional in the modified yeast cell. As used herein, the term </p><p>&lt;Desc/Clms Page number 8&gt;</p><p> &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;"promoter"refers&lt;/RTI&gt; to an untranscribed sequence located upstream (i. e. , 5') to the translation start codon of a structural gene (generally within about 1 to 1000 bp, preferably 1-500 bp, especially 1-100 bp) and which controls the start of transcription of the structural gene. Similarly, the &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;term"terminator"refers&lt;/RTI&gt; to an untranscribed sequence located downstream (i. e. , 3') to the translation finish codon of a structural gene (generally within about 1 to 1000 bp, more typically 1-500 base pairs and especially 1-100 base pairs) and which controls the end of transcription of the structural gene. A promoter or terminator is"operatively &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;linked"to&lt;/RTI&gt; a structural gene if its position in the genome relative to that of the structural gene such that the promoter or terminator, as the case may be, performs its transcriptional control function. </p><p> Promoters and terminator sequences may be native to the yeast cell or exogenous. Promoter and terminator sequences that are highly homologous (i. e. , 90% or more, especially 95% or more, most preferably 99% or more homologous) in their functional portions to functional portions of promoter and terminator sequences, respectively, that are native to the cell are useful as well, particularly when the insertion of the exogenous gene is targeted at a specific site in the &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;cell's&lt;/RTI&gt; genome. </p><p> A suitable promoter is at least &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;90%,&lt;/RTI&gt; 95% or 99% homologous to a promoter that is native to a yeast gene. A more suitable promoter is at least 90%, 95% or 99% homologous to a promoter for a gene that is native of the host cell. Particularly useful promoters include promoters for yeast pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC), phosphoglycerate kinase &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;(PGK),&lt;/RTI&gt; xylose reductase, (XR), xylitol dehydrogenase (XDH) and transcription enhancer factor-1 (TEF-1) genes, especially from such genes as are native to the host cell. </p><p> A suitable terminator is at least 90%, 95% or 99% homologous to a terminator that is native to a yeast gene. The terminator may be at least &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;90%,&lt;/RTI&gt; 95% or 99% homologous to a terminator for a gene that is native of the host cell. Particularly useful terminators include terminators for yeast pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC), xylose reductase, (XR), xylitol dehydrogenase (XDH) or iso-2-cytochrome c (CYC) genes, or a terminator from the galactose family of genes in yeast, particularly the so- called &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;GAL10&lt;/RTI&gt; terminator. A S. cerevisiae GAL10 terminator and a S. &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;cerevisiae&lt;/RTI&gt; CYC1 terminator have been shown to be effective terminators for exogenous XI genes in yeast. </p><p>&lt;Desc/Clms Page number 9&gt;</p><p> The use of native (to the host cell) promoters and terminators, together with respective upstream and downstream flanking regions, can permit the targeted integration of the XI gene into specific loci of the host cell's genome, and for simultaneous integration the XI gene and deletion of another native gene, such as, for example, an XR, XDH or PDC gene. </p><p> A poly-his (tidine) tail may be present at the 3'end of the XI gene. A method for accomplishing this is described in Example 3 below. The presence of the poly-his tail may diminish the performance of the XI gene, however. The poly-his tail is not critical to the invention and may be omitted if desired. </p><p> The exogenous XI gene may be integrated randomly into the host cell's genome or inserted at one or more targeted locations. Examples of targeted locations include the loci of a gene that is desirably deleted or disrupted, such as an XR, XDH or PDC gene. In some embodiments, integration of the XI gene adjacent to the site of a native PDC gene appears to be related to improved performance of the modified yeast cell in producing fermentation products. Integration at the PDC locus may be accomplished with or without deletion or disruption of the native PDC gene, but it is preferred to maintain the native PDC gene intact and functional, particularly when a desired fermentation product is ethanol or other product that is a pyruvate metabolite. </p><p> Targeted integration can be accomplished by designing a vector having regions that are homologous to the upstream (5'-) and downstream (3'-) flanks of the target gene. Either of both of these regions may include a portion of the coding region of the target gene. The XI cassette (including associated promoters and terminators if different from those of the target gene) and selection markers (with associated promoters and terminators as may be needed) will reside on the vector between the regions that are homologous to the upstream and downstream flanks of the target gene. </p><p> The genetically modified yeast cell may contain a single copy or multiple copies of the exogenous XI gene. If multiple copies of the exogenous XI gene are present, from 2 to 10 or more copies may be present, such as from about 2-8 or from about 2-5 copies. Multiple copies of the exogenous XI gene may be integrated at a single locus (so they are adjacent each other), or at several loci within the host cell's genome. In an embodiment of particular interest, multiple copies of the exogenous XI gene are incorporated at or adjacent to the locus of a native PDC gene, with or </p><p>&lt;Desc/Clms Page number 10&gt;</p><p> without deletion or disruption of the native PDC gene. It is possible for different exogenous XI genes to be under the control of different types of promoters and/or terminators. </p><p> Performance of the modified yeast, especially under anaerobic conditions, is improved by making one or more additional modifications to its genome, &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;and/or&lt;/RTI&gt; selecting host cells having certain characteristics. These include one or more of (1) low XR (or other aldose reductase) activity, (2) low XDH activity and (3) XK overexpression. </p><p> The host cell may naturally have or be modified to have low aldose reductase activity. Such a low aldose reductase activity, measured in the manner described in Example 4E below, is suitably less than 10 mU/mg or less than 5 mU/mg. If the host cell contains one or more aldose reductase genes that produce enzymes that catalyze the conversion of xylose to xylitol, one or more of these genes is suitably disrupted or deleted. In general, the gene (s) selected for disruption or deletion are those which individually or collectively (1) account for at least 40%, preferably at least 50% of the host &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;cell's&lt;/RTI&gt; &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;xylose- &gt; xylitol&lt;/RTI&gt; reduction activity, and/or (2) are XR genes, i. e. , genes that encode an enzyme specific to the &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;xyloseoxylitol&lt;/RTI&gt; reduction. It is generally preferred to delete or disrupt at least one XR gene. Deletion or disruption preferably achieves at least a 50% reduction in enzyme activity, and more preferably reduced xylose reductase activity to below 10 mU/mg or 5 &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;mU/mg.&lt;/RTI&gt; </p><p> By"delete or disrupt", it is meant that the entire coding region of the gene is eliminated (deletion), or the gene or its promoter and/or terminator region is modified (such as by deletion, insertion, or mutation) so that the gene no longer produces an active enzyme, or produces an enzyme with severely reduced activity. The deletion or disruption can be accomplished by genetic engineering methods, forced evolution or mutagenesis and/or selection or screening. In the case of the XR or non-specific aldose reductase gene, a suitable method for accomplishing this is to clone the upstream and downstream flanking regions for the gene (which may include a portion of the coding region for the gene), produce a vector containing the cloned upstream and downstream flanks, and transform the host cell with the vector. The vector may contain other genetic material such as a marker gene or other gene that is desirably inserted into the genome of the host cell at the locus of the native XR or non-specific aldose gene (such as an XI gene, XK gene or a gene that enables the cell to produce a desired fermentation product, as an L-or D-LDH gene). </p><p>&lt;Desc/Clms Page number 11&gt;</p><p> One method of deleting the XR or non-specific aldose reductase gene is to transform the host cell with a vector containing regions that are homologous to the upstream (5'-) and downstream (3'-) flanks of the target gene. Such flanking sequences can be obtained, for example, by amplifying the appropriate regions by PCR using suitably designed primers and genomic DNA as the template. Either of both of these regions may include a portion of the coding region of the target gene, although the vector should not contain the entire functional portion of the gene. Such flanking sequences are generally sequences of at least 50 base pairs, or at least 100 or at least 500 base pairs. Although there is in theory no upper limit to the length of the flanking sequence, it is preferably up to about 4000 base pairs, more preferably up to about 1200 base pairs in length. The flanking sequences are each at least 90%, preferably at least 95%, more preferably at least 98% and even more preferably at least 99% homologous to the corresponding sequences in the cell's genome. These flanking sequences may include the promoter and terminator sequences, respectively, of the target gene. The vector may in addition contain one or more selection marker cassettes (with associated promoters and terminators as may be needed) that advantageously reside between the regions that are homologous to the upstream and downstream flanks of the target gene. Such a vector can delete the target gene in a homologous recombination, inserting the selection marker gene at the locus of the deleted target gene. The vector may instead of or in addition to the selection marker cassette include another expression cassette, such as an XI expression cassette, and L-or D-LDH cassette or a xylulokinase expression cassette, all of which may include associated promoters and terminators. Vectors can also be designed to take advantage of spontaneous loopout events, such as are described in <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">WO 03/102152</bibl>. </p><p> The host cell may naturally have or be modified to have low xylitol dehydrogenase activity. Such a low xylitol dehydrogenase enzyme activity, measured in the manner described in Example 6B below, is suitably less than 2 mU/mg or less than 1 mU/mg. If the host cell contains one or more xylitol dehydrogenase genes resulting in higher xylitol dehydrogenase enzyme activities, one or more of these genes is suitably disrupted or deleted. XDH gene deletion or disruption can be performed in a way analogous to described before with respect to aldose reductase deletion or disruption. Deletion can be performed by incorporating upstream and downstream flanks of the XDH gene into a transformation vector, instead of the flanks of the XR or non-specific aldose reductase gene. As before, the vector may </p><p>&lt;Desc/Clms Page number 12&gt;</p><p> include one or more selection marker cassettes &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;and/or&lt;/RTI&gt; one or more other expression cassettes. Deletion or disruption preferably achieves at least a 50% reduction in enzyme activity, and more preferably reduced xylitol dehydrogenase activity to below 2 mU/mg or 1 mU/mg. </p><p> The modified cell preferably expresses a xylulokinase enzyme having an activity of at least 100 mU/mg, such as at least 300 mU/mg or at least 500 mU/mg, measured as described in Example 5E below. The xylulokinase enzyme is referred to variously as EC 2.7. 1.17 and systematically as ATP: D-xylulose 5-phosphotransferase. </p><p>Its activity is generally ATP + &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;D-xylulose = ADP &lt;/RTI&gt; + D-xylulose 5- &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;phosphateXylulokinase.&lt;/RTI&gt; Overexpression can be achieved, for example, by forced evolution (under conditions that favor selection of mutants that overexpress the enzyme), mutagenesis or by integrating one or more functional exogenous xylulokinase genes into the genome of the host cell. In this context,"exogenous" means (1) the XK gene is not native to the host cell, (2) the XK gene is native to the host cell, but the genome of the host cell has been modified to provide additional functional copies of the native XK gene, or (3) both (1) and (2). Suitable xylulokinase genes include yeast xylulokinase genes. A preferred example of a suitable XK gene is the S. cerevisiae XK gene &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;(ScXKSl).&lt;/RTI&gt; A nucleotide sequence for the &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;ScXKSl&lt;/RTI&gt; gene is identified as SEQ. ID. NO. 83. The deduced amino acid sequence for the enzymes produced by the &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;ScXKSl&lt;/RTI&gt; gene is identified as SEQ. ID. NO. 84. Suitable XK genes include those that are at least 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, 98% or 99% homologous to SEQ. </p><p>ID. NO. &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;83.&lt;/RTI&gt; Suitable XK genes include those that encode for enzymes that are at least 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, 98% or 99% homologous to SEQ. ID. NO. 84. Other suitable XK genes are native to K &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;marxianus&lt;/RTI&gt; or C. sonorensis, or are at least 70%, 80%, 80%, 95%, 98% or 99% homologous to either of these. </p><p> The exogenous XK gene is under the control of a promoter and a terminator, both of which are functional in the modified yeast cell. Suitable promoters and terminator sequences may be native to the host cell or exhibit a high homology (i. e., 90% or greater, especially 95% or greater, most preferably 99% or greater homology) to a native promoters or terminator. Such promoters and terminators are particularly useful when the exogenous XK gene is targeted at a specific site in the host &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;cell's&lt;/RTI&gt; genome. Other suitable promoters and terminators are native to the organism from which the XK gene was obtained or exhibit a similarly high homology to such native promoter and/or terminators. For example, suitable promoters and </p><p>&lt;Desc/Clms Page number 13&gt;</p><p> terminators for the &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;ScXKSl gene &lt;/RTI&gt; identified above include promoters and terminators for S. cerevisiae genes. The promoter and/or terminators may be those native to the particular XK gene or exhibit a similarly high homology to such promoter and/and terminator. </p><p> Particularly useful promoters for the &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;ScXKS1&lt;/RTI&gt; gene include S. &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;cerevisiae&lt;/RTI&gt; pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC), phosphoglycerate kinase &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;(PGK),&lt;/RTI&gt; xylose reductase, (XR), xylitol dehydrogenase &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;(XDH)&lt;/RTI&gt; and transcription enhancer factor-1 &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;(TEF-1)&lt;/RTI&gt; promoters. Particularly useful terminators for the &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;ScXKSl&lt;/RTI&gt; gene include S. cerevisiae pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC), xylose reductase, (XR), xylitol dehydrogenase &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;(XDH)&lt;/RTI&gt; or iso-2-cytochrome c (CYC) terminators, or a terminator from the galactose family of genes in yeast, particularly the so-called GAL10 terminator. A S. &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;cerevisiae&lt;/RTI&gt; GAL10 terminator and a S. &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;cerevisiae&lt;/RTI&gt; CYC1 terminator have been shown to be effective terminators for exogenous XI genes in yeast. </p><p> The exogenous XK gene may be integrated randomly into the host &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;cell's&lt;/RTI&gt; genome, or inserted at one or more targeted locations, using methods analogous to those for inserting the XR gene, as discussed above. Examples of targeted locations include the loci of a gene that is desirably deleted or disrupted, such as an XR, XDH or PDC gene. As before, targeted integration can be accomplished by designing a vector having regions that are homologous to the upstream (5'-) and downstream (3'-) flanks of the target gene. Either of both of these regions may include a portion of the coding region of the target gene. The XK cassette (including associated promoters and terminators if different from those of the target gene) and selection markers (with associated promoters and terminators as may be needed) will reside on the vector between the regions that are homologous to the upstream and downstream flanks of the target gene. </p><p> The genetically modified yeast cell may contain a single copy or multiple copies (such as from 2 to 10 or more copies, from 2 to 8 or from 2 to 5 copies) of the exogenous XK gene. Multiple copies of the exogenous XK gene may be integrated at a single locus (so they are adjacent each other), or at several loci within the host cell's genome. It is possible for different exogenous XK genes to be under the control of different types of promoters and/or terminators. </p><p> Cells according to the invention that have low xylose reductase activity, low xylitol dehydrogenase activity and overexpressed xylulokinase activity are excellent hosts for screening exogenous xylose isomerase genes for activity in the host cell. </p><p>&lt;Desc/Clms Page number 14&gt;</p><p>These genetic modifications create a cellular environment that tends to favor xylose isomerase expression, so if a certain gene is in fact active, its activity is less likely to be suppressed by the cellular environment and therefore be measurable in the cell. </p><p> Genetic modification of the host cell is accomplished in one or more steps via the design and construction of appropriate vectors and transformation of the host cell with those vectors. Electroporation and/or chemical (such as calcium chloride-or lithium acetate-based) transformation methods can be used. Methods for transforming yeast strains are described in <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">WO 99/14335</bibl>, <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">WO 00/71738</bibl>, <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">WO 02/42471</bibl>, <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">WO 03/102201</bibl>, <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">WO 03/102152</bibl> and <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">WO 03/049525</bibl>; these methods are generally applicable for transforming host cells in accordance with this invention. </p><p>The DNA used in the transformations can either be cut with particular restriction enzymes or used as circular DNA. </p><p> General approaches to transformation vector design have been discussed above in a general sense. Some specific transformation vector designs are as follows, with components listed in order of reading/transcription. All can be circularized or linearized.

A xylose isomerase gene can act in this manner, allowing selection to occur on the basis of the ability to grow on xylose. </p><p> Successful transformants can be selected for in known manner, by taking advantage of the attributes contributed by the marker gene, or by other characteristics (such as ability to grow on xylose) contributed by the inserted genes. </p><p>Screening can be performed by PCR or Southern analysis to confirm that the desired insertions and deletions have taken place, to confirm copy number and to identify the point of integration of genes into the host &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;cell's&lt;/RTI&gt; genome. Activity of the enzyme encoded by the inserted gene &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;and/or&lt;/RTI&gt; lack of activity of enzyme encoded by the deleted gene can be confirmed using known assay methods. </p><p> The genetically modified yeast cell of the invention containing the exogenous XI gene is useful to ferment pentose sugars to desirable fermentation products such as ethanol and lactic acid. Certain additional genetic modifications may be necessary to enable the yeast cell to produce certain products in acceptable yields, titers and/or productivity For example, integration of an exogenous LDH gene and deletion of native PDC genes may be necessary to obtain high lactic acid yields, as discussed before. </p><p> In the fermentation process of the invention, the cell of the invention is cultivated in a fermentation medium that includes a pentose sugar. The pentose sugar is preferably xylose, xylan or other oligomer of xylose. Such sugars are suitably hydrolysates of a &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;hemicelluose-containing&lt;/RTI&gt; biomass. The fermentation medium may contain other sugars as well, notably hexose sugars such as dextrose (glucose) fructose, oligomers of glucose such as maltose, maltotriose and isomaltotriose, and panose. In case of oligomeric sugars, it may be necessary to add enzymes to the fermentation broth in order to digest these to the corresponding monomeric sugar. </p><p> The medium will typically contain nutrients as required by the particular cell, including a source of nitrogen (such as amino acids proteins, inorganic nitrogen sources such as ammonia or ammonium salts, and the like), and various vitamins, minerals and the like. </p><p> Other fermentation conditions, such as temperature, cell density, selection of substrate (s), selection of nutrients, and the like are not considered to be critical to the invention and are generally selected to provide an economical process. Temperatures during each of the growth phase and the production phase may range from above the </p><p>&lt;Desc/Clms Page number 18&gt;</p><p> freezing temperature of the medium to about &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;50 C,&lt;/RTI&gt; although the optimal temperature will depend somewhat on the particular microorganism. A preferred temperature, particularly during the production phase, is from about &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;30-45 C.&lt;/RTI&gt; When the cell is an engineered K. marxianus, it can tolerate relatively high temperatures (such as above &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;40 C&lt;/RTI&gt; and up to &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;50 C,&lt;/RTI&gt; especially up to &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;45 C).&lt;/RTI&gt; Another preferred species of cell, C. sonorensis, can tolerate temperatures up to about &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;40 C.&lt;/RTI&gt; This temperature range provides for the possibility of conducting the fermentation at such higher temperatures (thereby reducing cooling costs) without a significant loss of productivity. Another advantage provided by the good high temperature tolerance is that if the fermentation becomes contaminated with an undesired microorganism, in many cases the undesired microorganism can be selectively killed off by heating the fermentation medium to &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;40 C&lt;/RTI&gt; or more, especially &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;45 C&lt;/RTI&gt; or more, without significantly harming the desired cells of the invention. </p><p> During the production phase, the concentration of cells in the fermentation medium is typically in the range of about 1-150, preferably about 3-10, even more preferably about 3-6 g dry cells/liter of fermentation medium. </p><p> The fermentation may be conducted aerobically, microaerobically or anaerobically. If desired, specific oxygen uptake rate can be used as a process control, as described in <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">WO 03/102200</bibl>. An advantage of the invention is that the genetically modified cell typically can ferment xylose anaerobically due to the expression of the XI gene and other modifications. </p><p> When the fermentation product is an acid, the medium may be buffered during the production phase of the fermentation so that the pH is maintained in a range of about 5.0 to about 9.0, preferably about 5.5 to about 7.0. Suitable buffering agents are basic materials that neutralize lactic acid as it is formed, and include, for example, calcium hydroxide, calcium carbonate, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, potassium carbonate, sodium carbonate, ammonium carbonate, ammonia, ammonium hydroxide and the like. In general, those buffering agents that have been used in conventional fermentation processes are also suitable here. It is within the scope of the invention, however, to allow the pH of the fermentation medium drop from a starting pH that is typically 6 or higher, to below the pKa of the acid fermentation product, such as in the range of about 2 to about 5 or in the range of from about 2.8 to about 4.5. </p><p>&lt;Desc/Clms Page number 19&gt;</p><p> In a buffered fermentation, acidic fermentation products such as lactic acid are neutralized as they are formed to the corresponding lactate salt. Recovery of the acid therefore involves regenerating the free acid. This is typically done by removing the cells and acidulating the fermentation broth with a strong acid such as sulfuric acid. A salt by-product is formed (gypsum in the case where a calcium salt is the neutralizing agent and sulfuric acid is the acidulating agent), which is separated from the acid. The acid is then recovered through techniques such as liquid-liquid extraction, distillation, absorption, etc. , such as are described in <bibl type="book" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">T. B.

Thermocycling was performed by initially incubating the reaction mixture for 2 minutes at &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;94 C,&lt;/RTI&gt; then by 35 cycles of 30 seconds at &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;94 C,&lt;/RTI&gt; 30 seconds at &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;55 C&lt;/RTI&gt; and 45 seconds at &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;72 C,&lt;/RTI&gt; followed by a final incubation of 4 minutes at &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;72 C.&lt;/RTI&gt; The PCR product was separated on a 0.8% agarose gel and a 535 bp product isolated. The PCR product was digested with Sbfl and MM and the resulting 529 bp fragment was ligated with the &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;SbfI-MluI&lt;/RTI&gt; fragment of pBH5a to produce plasmid pBH5b (Fig. 5). The pBH5b plasmid contains sequences corresponding to those flanking the &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;KmPDCl&lt;/RTI&gt; gene, i. e., &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;a-1.&lt;/RTI&gt; 2 kbp upstream flanking sequence and &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;a-0.&lt;/RTI&gt; 5 kbp of DNA downstream flanking sequence, with a single Sbfl </p><p>&lt;Desc/Clms Page number 22&gt;</p><p> site located between them. The pBH5b plasmid also contains the G418 resistance marker operatively linked to the &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;ScPDCl&lt;/RTI&gt; promoter and &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;ScGALlO&lt;/RTI&gt; terminator. </p><p>Example 1E : Construction of vector containing poly-his tag and S. cerevisiae CYC1 terminator &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;(pVR73,&lt;/RTI&gt; Fig. &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;6) ; &lt;/RTI&gt; removal of G418 resistance marker gene from &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;pBH5b&lt;/RTI&gt; (Ex. &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;1D,&lt;/RTI&gt; Fig. 5) to form vector &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;pVR77&lt;/RTI&gt; (Fig. 6) 
Primers identified as SEQ. ID. NO. 14 and SEQ. ID. NO. 15 were designed based on the pYES6CT vector (Invitrogen, CA) for the amplification of bases containing a multiple cloning site, poly-his tag, and S. cerevisiae CYC1 terminator &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;(ScCYCl).&lt;/RTI&gt; The primers introduced Sbfl and BsmBI sites to the product. PCR conditions were 30 cycles of 1 minute at &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;94 C,&lt;/RTI&gt; 1 minute at &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;55 C&lt;/RTI&gt; and 1 minute at &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;68 C,&lt;/RTI&gt; followed by a final incubation at &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;68 C&lt;/RTI&gt; for 10 minutes using Platinum Pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen, CA). The PCR product was column purified, followed by addition of adenine nucleotides to the 5'ends of TA cloning using Taq DNA polymerase incubated at &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;72 C&lt;/RTI&gt; for 10 minutes. The 507 bp product was then TA cloned into a TOPOII TA cloning vector (Invitrogen, &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;CA)&lt;/RTI&gt; and designated pVR73 (Fig. </p><p>6). The inclusion of the poly-his tag in this vector will cause genes cloned into the unique Sbfl site to have the his tag fused to the protein expressed from that gene. </p><p>This tagging of the protein with the poly-his tag allows for relatively quick western blot detection of the protein using &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;Ni-NTA&lt;/RTI&gt; (HRP) conjugate &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;(Quiagen,&lt;/RTI&gt; USA) and for rapid purification of the expressed gene using Ni-chelating resin and columns (Invitrogen, CA). </p><p> Plasmid pBH5b (Ex. &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;1D,&lt;/RTI&gt; Fig. 5) was digested with Sphl and &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;a ~4. &lt;/RTI&gt; 7 kbp fragment that retains the &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;KmPDCl&lt;/RTI&gt; promoter and terminator was &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;re-ligated&lt;/RTI&gt; to itself to make plasmid pVR77 (Fig. 6). The G418 antibiotic selection marker from pBH5b was thus eliminated. </p><p>Example 1F : Construction of a vector pVR78 (Fig. 6) containing the &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;KmPDCI&lt;/RTI&gt; upstream flanking region, multi-cloning site, poly-his tag and &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;ScCYCI&lt;/RTI&gt; terminator 
Plasmid &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;pVR73&lt;/RTI&gt; (Ex. &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;1E,&lt;/RTI&gt; Fig. 6) was digested with enzymes &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;Sbfl&lt;/RTI&gt; &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;and BsmBI &lt;/RTI&gt;to release a 504 bp fragment containing the multi-cloning site, poly-his tag and &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;ScCYCl&lt;/RTI&gt; terminator. Vector pVR77 was digested using the same enzymes to produce a-4249 bp fragment containing &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;the KmPDCl &lt;/RTI&gt; upstream and downstream flanks and vector backbone. The two fragments were ligated to form a-4752 bp plasmid &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;(pVR78,&lt;/RTI&gt; Fig. </p><p>6) that contained the unique Sbfl restriction site 184 bp from the poly-his tag.

Primers identified as SEQ. ID. NO. 16 and SEQ. ID.

The primers also had a 5'SbfI site immediately upstream of the poly-his tag and 3'SapI site. PCR reaction was performed using standard methods. PCR conditions consisted of an initial incubation at &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;94 C&lt;/RTI&gt; for 2 minutes, followed by 10 cycles of 30 seconds at &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;94 C,&lt;/RTI&gt; 30 seconds at &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;63 C&lt;/RTI&gt; and 1 minute at &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;68 C.&lt;/RTI&gt; This was followed by an additional 20 cycles of 30 seconds at &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;94 C,&lt;/RTI&gt; 1 minute at &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;68 C.&lt;/RTI&gt; The final step was an 8-minute incubation at &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;68 C.&lt;/RTI&gt; Amplification was performed using Platinum Pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen, CA).

PAGE purified primers are ordered starting from the center of the gene to reconstruct going out. 14-16 bp overlaps are maintained for the primer sets. </p><p>The primers are each 60-70 bp long. The gene was reconstructed in 17 steps. </p><p> The PCR protocol that was followed during this method used Platinum Pfx (Invitrogen, CA) as the DNA polymerase, and its buffer and &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;MgS04&lt;/RTI&gt; as directed by the manufacturer. Step 1 is performed using primers identified as SEQ. ID. NO. 20 and SEQ. ID. NO. 21. These primers represent the center of the gene sequence. No template is required in Step 1, as the annealing of the primers and its extension will form the core template on which subsequent PCR reactions will be built.

 Example 2B: Construction of vector &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;pCM17&lt;/RTI&gt; (Fig. 10) containing the reconstructed PXYLA gene; site-directed mutagenesis to alter bases on the reconstructed gene to coincide with the sequence in Genbank database 
A plasmid containing the reconstructed PXYLA gene (Ex. 2A) was constructed by &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;ligating&lt;/RTI&gt; &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;a-1.&lt;/RTI&gt; 314 kbp fragment produced in the final round of construction to a TOPOII vector (Invitrogen, CA). The reconstructed PXYLA gene differed from the Genbank sequence with respect to five bases. Each of these differences was corrected using a multi-site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, CA), using this plasmid as the template. Three PAGE or HPLC purified, 5'phosphorylated mutagenic primers identified as SEQ. ID. NO. 54, SEQ. ID. NO. 55 and SEQ. ID. NO. 56 were used to correct four of the errors. Thermal cycling parameters included a one-minute denaturation step and a one-minute annealing step, followed by an eight-minute extension. The parental strand formed during the PCR step was then digested by adding &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;11 Dp J&lt;/RTI&gt; enzyme to the mixture at the end of the thermocycling. The mixture was incubated for 1 hour at &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;37 C&lt;/RTI&gt; and then used to transform XL10-Gold &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;Ultracompetent&lt;/RTI&gt; E. coli cells supplied with the kit. The mixture was plated on Luria- </p><p>&lt;Desc/Clms Page number 26&gt;</p><p> Bertani + ampicillin (LBA) plates and incubated at &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;37 C&lt;/RTI&gt; overnight. The multi-site directed mutagenesis protocol was then repeated to fix the fifth error. Two PAGE or HPLC purified, 5'-phosphorylated mutagenic primers identified as SEQ. ID. NO. 57 and SEQ. ID. NO. 55 were used. Two transformants were sequenced and showed 100% homology to the Genbank sequence of the PXYLA gene. One of the constructs was named &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;pCM17&lt;/RTI&gt; (Fig. 10). The nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the reconstructed PXYLA gene are identified as SEQ. ID. NO. 58 and SEQ. ID NO. 59. </p><p>Example 3A: Construction of vector &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;pCM14&lt;/RTI&gt; (Fig. 11) containing the PXYLA gene under the control of &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;KmPDCI&lt;/RTI&gt; promoter and &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;ScCYCl&lt;/RTI&gt; terminator, and the E. coli hph hygromycin resistance gene under the control of &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;ScPDCI&lt;/RTI&gt; promoter and &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;ScGAL10&lt;/RTI&gt; terminator 
The PXYLA gene was PCR amplified using the primers identified as SEQ. ID. </p><p>NO. 60 and SEQ. ID. NO. 61, using &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;pCM17&lt;/RTI&gt; (Ex. &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;2B,&lt;/RTI&gt; Fig. 10) as a template. </p><p>&lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;Thermocychng&lt;/RTI&gt; was performed by 35 cycles of 30 seconds at &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;94 C,&lt;/RTI&gt; 30 seconds at &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;55 C,&lt;/RTI&gt; 1.5 minutes at &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;72 C,&lt;/RTI&gt; followed by a final incubation for 8 minutes at &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;72 C&lt;/RTI&gt; using Pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen, CA). The PCR product was digested with Sbfl and electrophoretically separated on a 1.0% agarose gel. A 1319 bp product was isolated and ligated to a-6829 bp fragment obtained by digesting pCM9 with Sbfl, to construct a-8148 bp plasmid. A mutagenic primer identified as SEQ. ID. NO. 62 was used to pull out a stop codon which was accidentally added immediately upstream of the Sbfl site, following the same protocol as described in Example Ex. </p><p>2B, to create &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;a ~8148 &lt;/RTI&gt; bp plasmid &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;(pCM14,&lt;/RTI&gt; Fig. 11). </p><p> Plasmid &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;pCM14&lt;/RTI&gt; contains the PXYLA gene under the control of the &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;KmPDCl&lt;/RTI&gt; promoter and the ScCYCl terminator, with a poly-his tail at the 3'end of the gene. </p><p>The plasmid also contains the E. coli hph gene under control of &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;ScPDCl&lt;/RTI&gt; promoter and &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;ScGAL10&lt;/RTI&gt; terminator. </p><p>Example 3B: Incorporation of a Ura3 selection marker into the &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;pCM14&lt;/RTI&gt; plasmid (Ex. 3A, Fig. 11), with deletion of the hph expression cassette 
Alani et al. , in"A method for gene disruption that allows repeated use of Ura3 selection in the construction of multiply disrupted yeast strains, " (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Genetics, 1987, 116,541-545</bibl>) has described a method of gene integration or gene disruption. This method makes use of a uracil auxotrophic yeast strain and a HisG-ScUra3-HisG repeater cassette. This cassette can be used as a selection marker to introduce genes or to disrupt genes with the advantage that the HisG cassette recombines with itself in subsequent generations. Thus the yeast cell loses the &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;ScUra3&lt;/RTI&gt; gene during the </p><p>&lt;Desc/Clms Page number 27&gt;</p><p> recombination event and this loss of ScUra3 gene restores back the yeast strain's uracil &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;auxotrophy&lt;/RTI&gt; for subsequent transformation with the same cassette. </p><p> A HisG-ScUra3-HisG cassette was obtained from Nancy DaSilva incorporated in a plasmid designated &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;pNADFll&lt;/RTI&gt; (Nancy DaSilva, UC Irvine, California). The HisG-ScUra3-HisG cassette was isolated from &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;pNADF11&lt;/RTI&gt; by digesting the plasmid with BamHI and EcoRI enzymes and ligating &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;a-3.&lt;/RTI&gt; 8 kbp fragment to a BamHI and EcoRI-digested plasmid &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;pPUC19&lt;/RTI&gt; (New England Biolabs, USA). The resulting plasmid is designated &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;pVR65&lt;/RTI&gt; (Fig. 19). </p><p> Plasmid &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;pCM14&lt;/RTI&gt; (Ex. 3A, Fig. 11) was digested with &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;AatII/SphI&lt;/RTI&gt; and electrophoretically separated on a 1% gel. A-5907 bp fragment containing the PXYLA cassette was isolated. Plasmid pVR65 was digested with &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;AatII/SphI&lt;/RTI&gt; and electrophoretically separated on a 1% gel. A-4293 bp HisG-ScUra3-HisG fragment was isolated and ligated to a-5907 bp fragment from plasmid &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;pCM14,&lt;/RTI&gt; with the inserts isolated. The resulting vector was identified as pCM28 (Fig. 12). It contains the PXYLA gene (with poly-his tag) under the control of the &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;KmPDC1&lt;/RTI&gt; promoter and ScCYCl terminator, and the HisG-Ura3-HisG cassette. The E. coli hph gene and flanking portions that were present in plasmid &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;pCM14&lt;/RTI&gt; are eliminated from pCM28. </p><p>Example 4A: Cloning of the &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;Kluyveromyces&lt;/RTI&gt; marxianus xylose reductase &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;(KmXYL1)&lt;/RTI&gt; gene and upstream and downstream flanks. </p><p> A 410bp fragment of a putative K. marxianus xylose reductase &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;(KmXYL1)&lt;/RTI&gt; coding region and approximately 500bp of the promoter has been determined by a partial genome sequencing of a &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;similar K marxianus &lt;/RTI&gt; within the &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;Genolevures&lt;/RTI&gt; project (Genomic Exploration of the Hemiascomycetous Yeasts: 12. &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;Kluyveromyces&lt;/RTI&gt; &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;marxianus var. marxianus &lt;/RTI&gt; Bertrand Llorente, Alain Malpertuy, &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;Gaelic&lt;/RTI&gt; Blandin, Frangois Artiguenave, Patrick Wincker and Bernard Dujon FEBS Letters 487 &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;(1) pp. &lt;/RTI&gt; </p><p>71-75). Based upon this sequence and some of the known sequences from other yeast xylose reductase consensus, primers were designed to isolate the full &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;KmXYLl&lt;/RTI&gt; gene sequence and promoter. A genome walking approach was used to obtain sequences upstream and downstream of a KmXYLl gene sequence from a wild type strain of K. marxianus. A genome walker kit (BD Biosciences, Paolo Alto, CA) was used for obtaining the sequence of the upstream and downstream flanks. Genomic DNA from &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;d&lt;/RTI&gt; marxianus was digested with restriction enzymes from the genome walker kit (Invitrogen, CA). A genomic library made with the fragments was used as template for PCR reactions. </p><p>&lt;Desc/Clms Page number 28&gt;</p><p> PCR primers identified as SEQ. ID. NO. 63 and SEQ. ID. NO. 64 were designed to walk both the 5'end and 3'end to get the xylose reductase and upstream/downstream flanking sequence. These primers were used to walk along with primers AP1 and AP2 from the genome walker kit (BD Biosciences, CA). This set of primers amplified a-2. 5 kbp fragment upstream of the gene. The fragment was sequenced to reveal the sequence of DNA from the extreme ends of the upstream region towards the &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;KmXYLl&lt;/RTI&gt; gene. Similarly, primers identified as SEQ. ID. NO. 65 and SEQ. ID. NO. 66 were used to walk along with primers API and AP2 from the genome walker kit. This amplified &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;a-1.&lt;/RTI&gt; 8 kbp fragment downstream of the KmXYLl gene. The fragment was sequenced to reveal the sequence of DNA from the extreme ends of the downstream region away from xylose reductase. </p><p> The sequence information obtained from the genome walking allowed the design of primers identified as SEQ. ID. NO. 67 and SEQ. ID. NO. 68. These primers were used for thermocycling reactions with 500 ng of genomic DNA from &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;K.&lt;/RTI&gt; &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;marxianus.&lt;/RTI&gt; Thermocycling was performed by 30 cycles of 1 minute at &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;94 C,&lt;/RTI&gt; 1 minute at &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;56 C,&lt;/RTI&gt; 3 minutes at &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;72 C,&lt;/RTI&gt; followed by a final incubation of 7 minutes at 72 C using Pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen, CA). The PCR product was electrophoretically separated on a 0.8% agarose gel. &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;A-3.&lt;/RTI&gt; 5 kbp product was isolated and ligated into the &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;pCRII&lt;/RTI&gt; topo-cloning vector to give plasmid pVR95 (FIG. 13). </p><p>Example 4B: Construction of plasmid &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;pCM19&lt;/RTI&gt; (Fig. 14b) containing the KmXYLl upstream and downstream flanks, and the &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;G418&lt;/RTI&gt; resistance marker gene under the control &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;of ScPDC1 &lt;/RTI&gt; promoter and &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;ScGAL10&lt;/RTI&gt; terminator. </p><p> Primers identified as SEQ. ID. NO. 69 and SEQ. ID. NO. 70 were designed to amplify &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;a-1.&lt;/RTI&gt; 3 kbp fragment from plasmid pVR95 (Ex. 4A, Fig 13). This fragment includes the promoter region of the &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;KmXYL1 gene &lt;/RTI&gt; as well &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;as-300&lt;/RTI&gt; bp of the coding region of the gene. These primers were used for thermocycling reactions with 50ng of plasmid DNA from pVR95 (Ex. 4A, Fig. 13). Thermocycling was performed by 30 cycles of 1 minute at &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;94 C,&lt;/RTI&gt; 1 &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;minute at 53'C, &lt;/RTI&gt; 1 minute at &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;68 C,&lt;/RTI&gt; and a final incubation of 8 minutes at &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;68 C&lt;/RTI&gt; using Pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen, CA). The PCR product was electrophoretically separated, digested with PstI and ligated to pVR29 (Ex. 1C, Fig. 4) that was also digested with &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;PstI.&lt;/RTI&gt; The plasmid obtained by this method was verified for correct orientation of the &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;KmXYL1&lt;/RTI&gt; gene and promoter region into the &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;pVR29&lt;/RTI&gt; vector. The plasmid is designated &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;pCM18&lt;/RTI&gt; (Fig. 14a). </p><p> Primers identified as SEQ. ID. NO. 71 and SEQ. ID. NO. 72 were designed to amplify &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;a-1.&lt;/RTI&gt; 1 kbp fragment from pVR95. This fragment includes a region </p><p>&lt;Desc/Clms Page number 29&gt;</p><p> downstream of &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;the KmXYl 1 &lt;/RTI&gt; gene beyond its terminator. These primers were used for thermocycling reactions with 50ng of plasmid DNA from pVR95. Thermocycling was performed by 30 cycles of 1 minute at &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;94 C,&lt;/RTI&gt; 1 minute at &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;59 C,&lt;/RTI&gt; 1 minute at &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;68 C,&lt;/RTI&gt; a final incubation of 8 minutes at &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;68 C&lt;/RTI&gt; using Pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen, CA). &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt; </p><p>Primers identified as SEQ. ID. NO. 73 and SEQ ID. NO. 74 were used for&lt;/RTI&gt; thermocycling reactions with 50 ng of the first PCR product described above to amplify it.

The PCR product obtained after the second thermocycling was electrophoretically separated, digested with ApaI and ligated to plasmid &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;pCM18&lt;/RTI&gt; that was also digested with &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;ApaI,&lt;/RTI&gt; to form vector &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;pCM19&lt;/RTI&gt; (Fig. 14b). </p><p>Plasmid &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;pCM19&lt;/RTI&gt; contained the downstream flank &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;of KmXYL1 &lt;/RTI&gt; gene and the upstream flank of KmXYLl gene (together &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;with-300&lt;/RTI&gt; bp of the coding region of the gene), separated by a cassette containing the G418 gene under the control of the &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;ScPDC1&lt;/RTI&gt; promoter and &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;ScGAL10&lt;/RTI&gt; terminator. Correct orientation of the &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;KmXYLl&lt;/RTI&gt; downstream region with regard to the G418 resistance gene was verified. </p><p>Example 4C: Construction of a &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;K&lt;/RTI&gt; marxianus uracil auxotroph (CD 683) by replacing a functional Ura3 gene with a non-functional gene. </p><p> The K. marxianus Ura3 &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;(KmUra3)&lt;/RTI&gt; gene was isolated using the genomic DNA as template and primers designed based on Genbank sequence (accession no. </p><p>&lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;AF528508).&lt;/RTI&gt; An 804 bp fragment was cloned into &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;pBluescript&lt;/RTI&gt; vector (Stratagene, Wisconsin) and labelled pBSKura3Myra (Fig. 15). </p><p> This plasmid was digested with &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;EcoRV&lt;/RTI&gt; and &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;a-4&lt;/RTI&gt; kbp fragment that has the &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;KmUra3 gene &lt;/RTI&gt; with a missing &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;EcoRV&lt;/RTI&gt; fragment was isolated and &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;re-ligated&lt;/RTI&gt; to form plasmid pBSDeltaUra3Km (Fig. 15). This plasmid had a non-functional gene &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;(DeltaUra3).&lt;/RTI&gt; The plasmid was digested using KpnI and NotI and used to transform a wild type strain of K. &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;marxianus.&lt;/RTI&gt; The transformants were selected on 5-FOA plates. </p><p>Colonies that grew on these plates were screened using primers designed in the missing region of the DeltaUra3 gene. Primers were also designed to isolate the entire gene and those fragments were sequenced to indicate that this new shorter non-functional DeltaUra3 gene had replaced the actual native &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;KmUra3&lt;/RTI&gt; gene in the transformants. The successfully transformed strains were designated CD683. Strain CD683 strain did not grow Sc-Ura plates, indicating that it was a uracil auxotroph. </p><p>&lt;Desc/Clms Page number 30&gt;</p><p>Example 4D: Generation of a &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;K.&lt;/RTI&gt; marxianus mutant (CD804) with deleted xylose reductase &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;(KmXYLI)&lt;/RTI&gt; gene by transforming strain CD683 (Ex. 4C) with plasmid &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;pCM19&lt;/RTI&gt; (Ex. 4B, Fig. 14b) 
A-5. 2 kbp fragment containing the upstream and downstream regions of the KmXYLl gene with a G418 resistance expression cassette in between was obtained by digesting &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;pCM19&lt;/RTI&gt; with &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;PvuII.&lt;/RTI&gt; This fragment was used to transform &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;K&lt;/RTI&gt; marxianus strain CD683 using standard electroporation methods. The transformed cells were recovered and plated on 10 g/L yeast extract, 20 g/L yeast peptone, 50 g/L glucose (YPD) + 50 &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;llg/ml&lt;/RTI&gt; G418 plates and incubated at &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;37 C&lt;/RTI&gt; for 48-96 hrs. 96 transformants that grew &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;on YPD &lt;/RTI&gt; + &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;50 ug/ml &lt;/RTI&gt; G418 plates were replica plated on YPX (10 g/L yeast extract, 20 g/L yeast peptone + xylose &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;50g/L)&lt;/RTI&gt; + &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;50 ug/ml &lt;/RTI&gt; G418 plates. </p><p>73 out of the 96 transformants failed to grow on YPX + 50 &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;llg/ml&lt;/RTI&gt; &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;G418&lt;/RTI&gt; plates, confirming their inability to use xylose as a carbon source. This inability indicates that the functional &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;KmXYLl&lt;/RTI&gt; gene had been deleted and replaced with the G418 cassette in a homologous recombination. Those transformants that were unable to use xylose as a carbon source were designated CD804. </p><p> The absence of a functional &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;Km-XTU&lt;/RTI&gt; gene was verified using PCR primers identified as SEQ.

The presence of the G418 gene was verified by PCR using primers identified as SEQ. ID. NO. 77 and SEQ. ID. NO. 78. The results indicated that the G418 resistance gene fragment was integrated at the locus of the KmXYLl gene. A further PCR using a set of primers identified as SEQ. ID. </p><p>NO. 79 and SEQ. ID. NO. 80 further confirms that the &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;G418&lt;/RTI&gt; resistance gene fragment replaced the native &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;KmXYLl&lt;/RTI&gt; gene. Southern analysis further confirms that the xylose reductase gene was eliminated from strain CD804. </p><p>Example 4E: Xylose reductase enzyme activity assay for strains CD683 (Ex. </p><p>4C) and CD804 (Ex. 4D) 
Separate baffled shake flasks &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;(250ml&lt;/RTI&gt; capacity) were inoculated with strains CD683 (Ex. 4C) and CD804 (Ex. 4D).

The breaking buffer consisted of 100 mM sodium phosphate buffer &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;(pH7.&lt;/RTI&gt; 0), 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 40 mg phenylmethyl sulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) </p><p>&lt;Desc/Clms Page number 31&gt;</p><p> (dissolved in 500 pi DMSO), and 4 Protease inhibitor cocktail tablets (Roche, CA) in a &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;200ml&lt;/RTI&gt; volume.

The supernatant was removed and run through a PD-10 desalting column according to the kit protocol (Amersham Bioscience). XR enzyme assay test solution consisted of 100 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 0.2 mM NADPH, 0.5 mM D-xylose in a total volume of &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;lml,&lt;/RTI&gt; to which varying amounts of enzyme solution was added and the absorbance was followed at 340 nm. NADPH usage indicates reductase enzyme activity. A blank solution without xylose was used to determine background NADPH usage. </p><p> Total protein was determined using Advanced Protein Assay Reagent (Cysoskeleton &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;&amp;num;ADV01)&lt;/RTI&gt; with BSA as a standard. The xylose reductase enzyme activity of strain CD683, as indicated by NADPH consumption, was 13.7 mU/mg protein. NAPDH consumption by strain CD804 was consistent with a xylose reductase activity of 4.4 mU/mg protein, rather than the expected activity of zero. </p><p>This NADPH usage by CD804 is attributed to a non-specific aldose reductase enzyme that is carrying out some conversion of xylose to xylulose. Strains CD683 and CD804 are plated alongside each other on YPX plates. Strain CD804 did not show any growth on those plates at the end of 4 days while strain CD683 grew well on those plates. </p><p>Example 5A: Construction of plasmid pVR67 (Fig. 16) containing a cloned Saccharomyces cerevisiae xylulokinase (ScXKS1) gene &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;S.&lt;/RTI&gt; cerevisiae cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC Accession &amp;num;38626) and grown under standard conditions. Genomic DNA from S. cerevisiae was extracted using conventional methodologies. PCR amplification reactions were performed using Pfx polymerase (Invitrogen, CA). Each reaction contained S. cerevisiae genomic DNA at a concentration of 500ng, each of 4dNTPs (i. e. , each of &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;dATP,&lt;/RTI&gt; &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;dGTP,&lt;/RTI&gt; dCTP and &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;dTTP)&lt;/RTI&gt; at a concentration of 0.2 mM, and each of the amplification primers identified as SEQ.

The resultant plasmid &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;(pVR67,&lt;/RTI&gt; Fig. 16) was sequenced to verify the ScXKSl gene sequence. The gene exhibits excellent homology to the known sequence in Genbank (Accession &amp;num; X61377). The </p><p>&lt;Desc/Clms Page number 32&gt;</p><p> nucleotide sequence of the &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;ScXKSl&lt;/RTI&gt; gene is identified as SEQ. ID. NO. 83. The amino acid sequence of the enzyme coded by this gene is identified as SEQ. ID. NO. 84. </p><p>Example 5B : Construction of plasmid pVR52 (Fig. 16) containing the &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;S.&lt;/RTI&gt; cerevisiae TEF1 &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;(ScTEF1)&lt;/RTI&gt; promoter and &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;ScGAL10&lt;/RTI&gt; terminator. </p><p> The S. &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;cerevisiae&lt;/RTI&gt; TEF1 &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;(ScTEF1)&lt;/RTI&gt; promoter was cloned out of pTEFZeo (Invitrogen, CA) vector. Primers identified as SEQ. ID. NO. 85 and SEQ. ID. NO. 86 were used to amplify the &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;ScTEF1&lt;/RTI&gt; promoter and insert &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;XbaI&lt;/RTI&gt; and SstI restriction sites. </p><p>The PCR product and plasmid pNC2 (Ex. &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;LA,&lt;/RTI&gt; Fig. 1) were digested with &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;XbaI&lt;/RTI&gt; and SstI enzymes and ligated to obtain plasmid &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;pVR52&lt;/RTI&gt; (Fig. 16). </p><p>Example 5C: Construction of plasmid &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;pVR103&lt;/RTI&gt; (Fig. 18) containing the &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;ScXKSl&lt;/RTI&gt; gene under the control of the &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;ScTEF1&lt;/RTI&gt; promoter and ScGallO terminator. </p><p> Plasmid pVR67 (Ex. 5A, Fig. 16) was digested with &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;XbaI&lt;/RTI&gt; and BamHI. &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;A ~1. &lt;/RTI&gt; 8 kbp fragment containing the ScXKS1 gene was gel purified. Plasmid pVR52 (Ex. 5B, Fig. 16) was also digested with &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;XbaI&lt;/RTI&gt; and BamHI and the fragment so obtained was ligated to &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;the-1.&lt;/RTI&gt; 8 kbp fragment from pVR67 to form plasmid vector pVR96 (Fig. 16). </p><p>This plasmid contains the &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;ScXKS1&lt;/RTI&gt; gene under the control of the &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;ScTEF1&lt;/RTI&gt; promoter and ScGallO terminator. In this vector, the ATG start site of the ScXKS1 gene is about 130 bp away from the end of the &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;ScTEF1&lt;/RTI&gt; promoter. To reduce this distance to about 70-73 bp, primers identified as SEQ. ID. NO. 87 and SEQ. ID. NO. 88 were designed that would amplify the &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;ScTEF1&lt;/RTI&gt; promoter from pTEFzeo vector with the correct distance and restriction sites. pTEFzeo (Invitrogen, CA) was used as the template. Thermocycling was performed by 30 cycles of 30 seconds at &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;94 C,&lt;/RTI&gt; 30 seconds at &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;57 C,&lt;/RTI&gt; and 30 seconds at &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;72 C,&lt;/RTI&gt; followed by a final incubation of 4 minutes at &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;72 C&lt;/RTI&gt; using the Failsafe PCR System (Epicentre, Madison, &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;WI).&lt;/RTI&gt; The PCR product was separated on a 0.8% agarose gel and a 460 bp fragment was isolated. A second PCR was performed to amplify this fragment using the primers identified as SEQ. &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;ID.&lt;/RTI&gt; </p><p>NO. 89 and SEQ. ID. NO. 90. The PCR product was digested with EcoRI and ligated to EcoRI-digested plasmid &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;pVR96&lt;/RTI&gt; (Fig. 16). The resultant plasmid &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;(pVR102,&lt;/RTI&gt; Fig. 17) had two &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;ScTEFl&lt;/RTI&gt; promoters-the second one being the promoter driving the ScXKS1 gene. The distance between the end of the promoter and the ATG of the gene was exactly 73 bp. Plasmid pVR102 was digested with &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;SphI&lt;/RTI&gt; and ligated to SphI-digested &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;pPUC19&lt;/RTI&gt; (New England Biolabs, USA). The resultant plasmid &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;(pVR103,&lt;/RTI&gt; Fig. 18) was </p><p>&lt;Desc/Clms Page number 33&gt;</p><p> sequenced to verify the &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;ScXKS1&lt;/RTI&gt; gene under the control of a &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;ScTEF1&lt;/RTI&gt; promoter and &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;tScGALO&lt;/RTI&gt; terminator. </p><p>Example 5D: Construction of plasmid pVR104 (Fig. 19) containing the ScXKS1 expression cassette (from &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;pVR103,&lt;/RTI&gt; Ex. 5C) alongside a HisG-ScUra3- HisG cassette (from &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;pVR65,&lt;/RTI&gt; Ex. 3B). </p><p> Plasmid pVR65 (Ex. 3B, Fig. 19) was digested with SphI, and the 5'-phosphate ends of the linearized vector were dephosphorylated using shrimp alkaline phosphatase (Roche Diagnostics, USA) following the manufacturer's protocol. </p><p> Plasmid pVR103 (Ex. &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;5C,&lt;/RTI&gt; Fig. 18) was also digested with &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;SphI&lt;/RTI&gt; and a 3.5 kbp fragment that has the ScXKS1 gene under the control of the &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;ScTEF1&lt;/RTI&gt; promoter and &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;ScGAL10&lt;/RTI&gt; terminator was ligated to the linearized pVR65 fragment to obtain plasmid pVR104 (Fig. 19). </p><p>Example 5E: Generation of a &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;K.&lt;/RTI&gt; &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;marxianus&lt;/RTI&gt; mutant (CD805) that has an over- expressed &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;ScXKS1&lt;/RTI&gt; gene activity and deleted xylose reductase gene by transforming strain CD804 (Ex. 4D). </p><p> A-6. 8 kbp PvuII fragment from plasmid pVR104 (Ex. 5D, Fig. 19) was used to transform strain CD804 (Ex. 4D), using standard electroporation methods. The transformed cells were recovered in YPD medium, plated after 4 hours on SC-Ura plates &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;(Qbiogene,&lt;/RTI&gt; CA) and incubated at &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;37 C&lt;/RTI&gt; for 48-72 hours. Transformants that grew on SC-Ura plates at the end of 72 hours were re-streaked on fresh SC-Ura plates. Re-streaked transformants were screened using colony PCR. </p><p> A single positive colony of the transformed strain was inoculated into 50 ml of YPD medium and incubated overnight at &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;37 C&lt;/RTI&gt; with 200 rpm shaking. &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;10&lt;/RTI&gt; ul of this was plated on 5-FOA plates and incubated overnight at &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;37 C.&lt;/RTI&gt; Colonies that grew were resistant to 5-FOA and were expected to have lost the &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;ScUra3&lt;/RTI&gt; gene due to the recombination of the HisG regions. PCR was performed using primers identified as SEQ. ID. NO. 91 and SEQ. ID.

These two primer sets confirmed that the ScXKSl gene had integrated into the chromosome of the transformants and the &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;ScUra3&lt;/RTI&gt; gene had been removed by spontaneous recombination of the HisG region.

Total protein was determined using Advanced Protein Assay Reagent (Cysoskeleton &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;&amp;num;ADV01)&lt;/RTI&gt; with BSA as a standard. Enzyme analysis of strain CD805 (Ex. 5E) yielded an enzyme activity of 14.5 &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;+/-1.&lt;/RTI&gt; 6mU/mg, while the activity strain CD806 was 0.0 &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;+/-O.&lt;/RTI&gt; &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;lmU/mg.&lt;/RTI&gt; These results indicate that xylitol dehydrogenase enzyme activity had been deleted in strain CD806. </p><p>Example 7A: Generation of &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;K.&lt;/RTI&gt; marxianus mutant &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;(CD882)&lt;/RTI&gt; having exogenous PXYLA gene, overexpressed &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;ScXKS1&lt;/RTI&gt; gene activity, and deletions of the &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;KmXYL1&lt;/RTI&gt; and &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;KmXYL2&lt;/RTI&gt; genes by transforming strain CD806 (Ex. 6B) with plasmid pCM28 (Ex. 3B, Fig. 12) 
A single colony of strain CD806 was transformed with &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;NaeI-digested&lt;/RTI&gt; plasmid pCM28 using standard electroporation methods. The transformants were grown at 37 C overnight, and streaked onto five identical Sc-Ura plates for screening. The presence of the PXYLA gene was verified by PCR using primers identified as SEQ. </p><p>ID. NO. 110 and SEQ. ID. NO. 111. The resulting transformant (designated CD882) contained the reconstructed PXYLA gene, overexpressed &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;ScXKS1&lt;/RTI&gt; gene activity, and deletions of the &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;KmXYL1 and KmXYL2 &lt;/RTI&gt; genes. </p><p>Example 7B: &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;Enzymatic&lt;/RTI&gt; and Western Analysis of Strain CD882 (Ex. 7A) 
Protein from CD882 was column purified using Probond &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;Ni2+&lt;/RTI&gt; chelating resin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) binding the 6X poly-his tail. A &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;Ni-NTA-HRP&lt;/RTI&gt; conjugated probe (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) was used for direct detection of tagged proteins. Western analysis of fractions collected during purification further confirms the presence of the XI protein in strain CD882. Enzyme activity measurements were done according to the method described in"The Streptomyces rubiginosus xylose isomerase is misfolded when expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae", Gardonyl et al., 2003. The evaluation confirms xylose isomerase activity in the same fraction where </p><p>&lt;Desc/Clms Page number 38&gt;</p><p> the 6X poly-his tail PXYLA gene had been detected by western analysis in strain CD882. </p><p>Example 8A: Construction of plasmid (pCM29, Fig. 21) containing reconstructed PXYLA gene with stop codon that prevents encoding of the poly-his tail. </p><p> The reconstructed PXYLA gene (Ex. 2A) was PCR amplified using the primers identified as SEQ. ID. NO. 112 and SEQ. ID. NO. 113 using pCM17 (Ex. 2B, Fig. 10) as a template. Thermocycling was performed by 35 cycles of 30 seconds at &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;94 C,&lt;/RTI&gt; 30 seconds at &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;55 C,&lt;/RTI&gt; 1.5 minutes at &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;72 C,&lt;/RTI&gt; followed by a final incubation for 8 minutes at 72 C using Pfx DNA polymerase. The PCR product was digested with &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;SbfI&lt;/RTI&gt; and electrophoretically separated on a 1.0% agarose gel. A 1319 bp product was isolated and ligated to a &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;6829&lt;/RTI&gt; bp fragment obtained by digesting plasmid pCM9 (Ex. &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;1I,&lt;/RTI&gt; Fig. </p><p>9) with Sbfl to construct &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;a-8148&lt;/RTI&gt; bp plasmid (pCM29, Fig. 21). The plasmid contained the PXYLA gene with inoperable poly-his tail, under the control of &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;KmPCD1&lt;/RTI&gt; promoter and &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;ScCYC1&lt;/RTI&gt; terminator, and the E. coli hph expression cassette. </p><p>Example 8B: Generation of a K. marxianus mutant strain (CD861) containing non-his-tagged PXYLA gene, overexpressed &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;ScXKS1&lt;/RTI&gt; gene activity and deleted xylose dehydrogenase and xylose reductase genes, by transforming strain CD806 (Ex. 6B) with plasmid pCM29 (Ex. 8A, Fig. 21) 
A 3.192 Kb &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;PvuII/SphI&lt;/RTI&gt; fragment obtained by digesting pCM29 is used to transform strain CD806, using standard electroporation methods. The transformed cells were recovered in YPD medium and plated after 6 hours on YPX + &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;300ug/ml&lt;/RTI&gt; &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;G418&lt;/RTI&gt; + &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;150ug/ml&lt;/RTI&gt; hygromycin (pH 7.0). After 5 days at &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;30 C,&lt;/RTI&gt; several hundred small colonies and one larger colony had grown. The large colony was designated CD861. </p><p> Genome walking was performed on strain CD861 to ascertain how the PXYLA gene had integrated. The PXYLA gene was found to have integrated with more than one copy immediately upstream of the promoter region of the native PDC gene. One copy was under the control of &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;a-1236 bp KmPDC1 &lt;/RTI&gt; promoter region, present in plasmid pCM29, which includes about 142 bp of an upstream gene, and the &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;ScCYC1&lt;/RTI&gt; terminator. Another copy was immediately downstream of this &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;ScCYCl&lt;/RTI&gt; terminator, and included a 1026 bp promoter that matches the &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;native KmPDC1 &lt;/RTI&gt; promoter length. </p><p>This promoter is missing the 142 bp region of the upstream gene and an additional -68 bp at the 5'end, compared to the promoter in pCM29 and the first copy. The second copy was also under the control of a &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;ScCYCl&lt;/RTI&gt; terminator. Immediately </p><p>&lt;Desc/Clms Page number 39&gt;</p><p> downstream of this second &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;ScCYCj&lt;/RTI&gt; terminator was the native, 1026 &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;bp KmPDC1 &lt;/RTI&gt; promoter, followed by the native &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;KmPDC1&lt;/RTI&gt; gene. </p><p>Example 8C: Xylose isomerase, xylose reductase, xylitol dehydrogenase and xylulokinase enzyme analysis of CD861 (Ex. 8B) 
Separate baffled shake flasks (250 ml capacity) were inoculated with CD806 (Ex. 6B) and CD861 (Ex. 8B). Flasks were incubated at &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;30 C&lt;/RTI&gt; and grown overnight with shaking at 250 rpm. The media consisted of 20 &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;g/L&lt;/RTI&gt; yeast extract, 10 &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;g/L&lt;/RTI&gt; peptone and 100 g/L dextrose supplemented with &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;300&lt;/RTI&gt; &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;ug/ml&lt;/RTI&gt; G418 and 150 &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;llg/ml&lt;/RTI&gt; hygromycin. </p><p>Cells were lysed using Y-PER solution (Pierce-Rockford, IL) followed by de-salting using PD-10 columns (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;NJ).&lt;/RTI&gt; A test solution consisting of 100 mM &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;TES-NaOH,&lt;/RTI&gt; 250 mM xylose, 10 mM &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;MgCl2,&lt;/RTI&gt; 0.6 mM NADH, 1 U SDH (sigma) (pH 7.0) was brought up to 1.0 mL with the addition of 100 uL of cell extract. Xylose isomerase activity was determined using a blank with the same test solution, only without xylose. Xylose isomerase activity for strain CD806 was zero, while that of strain CD861 was 1.07 +/-0.21U/mg of crude extract. This verifies that strain CD861 contained a functioning xylose isomerase gene. </p><p> Xylose reductase, xylitol dehydrogenase and xylulokinase assays were also conducted to verify activity/loss of activity in the final strain. Strain &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;CD861&lt;/RTI&gt; (Ex. 8B) and strain CD683 (Ex. 4C) were separately grown overnight in media consisting of 20 g/L yeast extract, 10 &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;g/L&lt;/RTI&gt; peptone, and 100 g/L dextrose (supplemented with &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;300 jug/ml &lt;/RTI&gt; G418 and 150 &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;yg/ml&lt;/RTI&gt; hygromycin for strain CD861). Cells were lysed using the Y-PER solution. Total protein was determined using Advanced Protein Assay Reagent (Cysoskeleton &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;&amp;num;ADV01)&lt;/RTI&gt; with BSA as a standard. Xylose reductase enzyme activity in strain CD861 was 260 +/-41.8mU/mL vs. &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;516.&lt;/RTI&gt; 5 +/-10.6mU/mL for strain CD683. </p><p>&lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;The-50%&lt;/RTI&gt; reduction in activity indicates the deletion of the xylose reductase gene, with the measured activity being attributed to a non-specific aldose reductase enzyme that is carrying out some conversion of xylose to xylulose. Xylitol dehydrogenase enzyme activity was 12.4 +/-4.4mU/mL for strain CD861 vs. 110.4 +/-7.2 mU/mL for strain CD683. Xylulokinase enzyme activity was 370. 5 +/-147.6 mU/mL for strain CD861 vs. 44.8 +/-8.2 mU/mL for strain CD683. </p><p>Example 8D: Kinetic analysis of PXYLA gene in strain CD861 (Ex. 8B) 
A single colony of strain CD861 was inoculated for overnight growth in media consisting of 10 g/L yeast extract, 20 g/L peptone, and 100 g/L dextrose. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed once with 10 ml 100 mM sodium phosphate, 1 </p><p>&lt;Desc/Clms Page number 40&gt;</p><p> mM PMSF (pH 7. &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;0&lt;/RTI&gt; and centrifuged again.

Cells were spun down and the supernatant was desalted using PD-10 columns (Amersham Biosciences). </p><p>Enzyme assays were conducted as described in Example 8C, with the only difference being the substrate was varied from 0.05-lOmM xylose. Km and &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;Vmax&lt;/RTI&gt; were derived from &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;Michaelis-Menten&lt;/RTI&gt; plots, which gave a corresponding &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;Vmax&lt;/RTI&gt; &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;of-1.&lt;/RTI&gt; 8 with a corresponding Km of 2.2 mM xylose. A Linweaver-Burk plot gave a corresponding &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;Vmax&lt;/RTI&gt; &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;of ~1. &lt;/RTI&gt;0 with a corresponding Km of 1.2 mM xylose. </p><p>Example 8E: Inhibition studies of PXYLA activity in strain CD861 (Ex. &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;8B)&lt;/RTI&gt; using xylitol 
Strain CD861 was grown in xylose media containing varying concentrations of xylitol, a known xylose isomerase inhibitor. The Km for the xylose isomerase enzyme doubled when xylitol levels are increased from 0 to 0.25mM, and doubled again when xylitol levels are increased to 0.50mM. </p><p>Example &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;8F&lt;/RTI&gt; : pH tolerance of PXYLA gene in strain CD861 (Ex. 8B)

Cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed once with 10 ml 100 mM sodium phosphate, &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;1mM&lt;/RTI&gt; PMSF (pH 7.0) and centrifuged again. To this, 2 ml of Y-PER solution was added and gently re-suspended and the cell solution was incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes with intermittent agitation.

To this 100 &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;pL&lt;/RTI&gt; of enzyme or a dilution thereof was added to bring the final volume to 1 mL. Enzyme activity was measured as in Example &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;8C.&lt;/RTI&gt; The optimum activity was obtained at pH 6.5. At pH 5.9 the protein retained 45% of the maximum activity. </p><p>Example 9A: Microaerobic shake flask characterisation of strains CD806 (Ex. 6B), CD861 (Ex. 8B), and CD882 &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;(Ex&lt;/RTI&gt; &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;7A).&lt;/RTI&gt; </p><p> Single colonies of strains CD806, &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;CD861&lt;/RTI&gt; and CD882 were separately inoculated for overnight growth in 100 ml media consisting of 20 g/L yeast extract, 10 g/L peptone, and 100 &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;g/L&lt;/RTI&gt; dextrose supplemented with 300 &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;ug/ml&lt;/RTI&gt; &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;G418&lt;/RTI&gt; and 300 &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;Kug/ml&lt;/RTI&gt; hygromycin.

Plasmid &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;pVR118 is &lt;/RTI&gt; similar to plasmid &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;pCM31,&lt;/RTI&gt; but contains a stop codon that prevents encoding of the poly-his tail. </p><p>Example 11B: Generation of &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;K.&lt;/RTI&gt; marxianus mutant strains containing reconstructed PXYLA gene with (CD929) and without (CD931) encoded poly- his tag, together with ScUra3 gene without flanking His repeats, by transforming strain CD806 (Ex. 6B) with plasmids pCM31 (Ex. 11A, Fig. 23) and pVR118 (Ex. 11A, Fig. 24) 
A single colony &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;of K. marxianus &lt;/RTI&gt; strain CD806 (Ex. 6B) was transformed with plasmid pCM31 using standard electroporation methods.

Single colonies of CD929 and CD931 (Ex. 11B) were separately inoculated into 100 mL of 10 g/L yeast extract, 20 g/L peptone, 70 g/L glucose, 300 &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;ug/ml&lt;/RTI&gt; G418 + &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;150ug/ml&lt;/RTI&gt; hygromycin in a 250 mL baffled shake flask. The cultures were incubated overnight at &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;35 C&lt;/RTI&gt; with 250 rpm. The cells were inoculated into 50 mL falcon tubes containing 45 mL production media (10 &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;g/L&lt;/RTI&gt; yeast extract, 20 g/L peptone, 50 &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;g/L&lt;/RTI&gt; xylose, 100 mM Tes-NaOH, 10 mM &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;MgCl2,&lt;/RTI&gt; pH 7.0), to an OD of 0.2.

Strain CD931 produced 15.2 g/L EtOH while accumulating 4.5 g/L of xylulose. The relative performance of these strains indicates that ethanol formation is about nine times greater when the xylose isomerase gene does not contain the poly-his tag. Similarly, xylulose formation is increased four-fold when the poly-his tail is absent. </p><p>Example 12A: Reinsertion of &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;KmXYL2&lt;/RTI&gt; gene into strain CD861 (Ex. 8B) by transformation with plasmid pCM52 (Fig. 25); shake flask evaluations of the resulting transformants 
The &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;KmXYL2&lt;/RTI&gt; gene along with 982 bp of the 5'flank and 200 bp of the 3'flank was amplified from genomic DNA of a wild type K. marxianus strain, using primers identified as SEQ.

Transformants were plated onto Sc-Ura plates and incubated at &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;37 C.&lt;/RTI&gt; Primers identified as SEQ. ID. NO. 104 and SEQ. ID. NO. 105 were used to amplify the coding region of the &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;KmXYL2&lt;/RTI&gt; gene and primers identified as SEQ. ID. NO. 120 and SEQ. ID. NO. 121 were used to amplify the region containing the ScUra3 gene through the 5'flank of and into the coding region of the &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;KmXYL2&lt;/RTI&gt; gene.

The flasks are put into production at &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;35 C&lt;/RTI&gt; and 70 rpm shaking. Strain CD861 (Ex. 8B) is similarly cultivated, to compare the effect of the &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;KmXYL2&lt;/RTI&gt; re-insertion. </p><p> Strain CD861 has a volumetric productivity of 0.46 &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;g/L-hr&lt;/RTI&gt; and a xylose consumption rate of 1.47 &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;g/L-hr.&lt;/RTI&gt; The five XDH+ transformants averaged 70% lower productivity and 65% lower xylose consumption. &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;After-48&lt;/RTI&gt; hours, strain CD861 produced-14 g/L ethanol and-4. 7 g/L xylitol, whereas the five XDH+ transformants produced-2. 8-6. 3 g/L ethanol and 1.2-2. 2 g/L xylitol. All but one of the XDH+ transformants stopped producing ethanol after about 40 hours, although they all continued to consume xylose linearly past 40 hours. </p><p> Cells taken at the start of production and after 67 hours of production are lysed and protein quantification was performed using the advanced protein assay reagent (Cytoskeleton-USA). A 10X solution was prepared by adding 2.355 ml 1M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) to 5 mg &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;B-NADH&lt;/RTI&gt; (Sigma), ending in a final NADH concentration of 1.5 mM. Water is added to a volume of 950 uL (less sample volume). </p><p>Cell free extract is then added and absorbance followed at 340 nm for several minutes to determine background. 50 &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;pL&lt;/RTI&gt; of 0.4 M xylulose was then added and absorbance at 340 nm was followed to determine XDH activity. XDH activity for the five XDH+ transformants taken at the start of production ranged from 287-374 mU/mg. After 67 hours production, XDH activities ranged from 62-86 mU/mg. XDH activity for strain CD861 was 16 mU/mg at the start of production and 3 mU/mg after 67 hours of production. </p><p>Example 12B: Deletion of &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;ScXKSl&lt;/RTI&gt; gene from strain CD861 &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;(Ex.&lt;/RTI&gt; &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;8B)&lt;/RTI&gt; by transformation with plasmid &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;pCM28&lt;/RTI&gt; (Ex. 3B, Fig. 12); shake flask evaluations of the resulting transformants 
Plasmid pCM28 was separately linearized with &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;NaeI&lt;/RTI&gt; and PvuII and transformed into strain CD861 using standard electroporation methods. Cells were recovered &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;in YPD &lt;/RTI&gt; for 3 hours followed by plating onto Sc-Ura dropout media. 32 colonies were re-streaked onto duplicate plates. These were PCR screened using </p><p>&lt;Desc/Clms Page number 46&gt;</p><p> primers identified as SEQ. ID. NO. 122 and SEQ. ID. NO. 123 to amplify the coding region of the ScXKS1 gene. Six colonies that failed to produce the band (so indicating the absence of the &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;ScXKS1&lt;/RTI&gt; gene) were inoculated overnight in YPD to allow loopout of the &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;ScUra3&lt;/RTI&gt; gene, and plated onto FOA plate to select for those in which the loopout event occurred. Colonies that arose were re-streaked onto YPD to select for single colony isolates. One isolate from each transformation was screened using the above primers, and also for the presence of PXYLA, &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;KmXYLl&lt;/RTI&gt; and KmXYL2 genes. An additional PCR screening was performed to screen for a double crossover event, in which the &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;ScXKS1&lt;/RTI&gt; cassette was replaced with the PXYLA cassette from plasmid pCM28. All six isolates tested positive for PXYLA and negative for &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;KmXYL1,&lt;/RTI&gt; &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;KmXYL2&lt;/RTI&gt; and &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;ScXKS1&lt;/RTI&gt; genes. One of these was designated &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;CD1065&lt;/RTI&gt; and sent forward for shake flask evaluation. </p><p> Strains CD1065 and CD861 were separately inoculated into 250-ml shake flasks containing 50 ml YPD, and incubated overnight at &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;37 C&lt;/RTI&gt; and 250 rpm. Cells were harvested and 4 &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;gcdw&lt;/RTI&gt; were inoculated into 50 ml YPX. The flask was incubated at &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;35 C&lt;/RTI&gt; and shaken at 70 rpm. Samples were withdrawn periodically to monitor fermentation activity. Strain &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;CD1065&lt;/RTI&gt; exhibits a 10-20 hour time lag during which it consumes xylose very slowly. This is attributed to glucose repression of native xylulokinase genes. After this induction period, the xylose consumption rate increases, and strain CD1065 produces about 13 g/L ethanol after 65 hours. Strain CD861 produces ethanol much more rapidly, producing about 18 &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;g/L&lt;/RTI&gt; ethanol after about 20 hours. Strain CD1065 produces about 3.7 g/L xylulose after about 20 hours, but xylulose concentration decreases gradually thereafter. Xylulokinase activity is about 0 for strain CD1065 and about 417 mU/mg for strain CD861. Xylose consumption rates for strain CD861 are approximately double those of strain CD1065. Xylose isomerase activity is about 0.96 U/mg for strain CD1064 and about 1.79 U/mg for strain CD861. These results indicate that the overexpression of xylulokinase significantly improves xylose utilization and ethanol production rates under these conditions. </p><p> Cells from strains CD861 and CD1065 were removed following the production phase, streaked onto YPX plates and placed in an anaerobe jar. Both grew comparably. </p><p>&lt;Desc/Clms Page number 47&gt;</p><p>Example &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;12C&lt;/RTI&gt; : Reinsertion of &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;KmXYL1&lt;/RTI&gt; gene into strain CD861 (Ex. &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;8B)&lt;/RTI&gt; by transformation with plasmid &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;pCM55&lt;/RTI&gt; (Fig. 26); shake flask evaluations of the resulting transformants

A plasmid is constructed in the same manner as described for plasmid pCM52 (Ex. 12A, Fig. 25), except that the &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;KmXYL2&lt;/RTI&gt; gene flanks are oriented in the opposite direction than in plasmid pCM52. This plasmid is designated pCM53. The &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;KmXYL2&lt;/RTI&gt; gene in plasmid pCM53 is sequenced and found to contain four errors, three of which are silent and the other amounts to a mutation of amino acid &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;260rev.&lt;/RTI&gt; </p><p> The &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;KXITJ&lt;/RTI&gt; gene along with region of the 5'flank and a region of the 3'flank of the gene was amplified from genomic DNA of a wild type &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;d mara, zanus &lt;/RTI&gt; strain, using primers identified as SEQ. ID. NO. 130 and SEQ. ID. NO. 131. These primers introduce Sacl and Notl restriction sites. The resulting PCR product was digested with Sacl and NotI and ligated to a similarly digested plasmid pCM53. The resulting plasmid was designated pCM58 (Fig. 27). Primers identified as SEQ. ID. NO. 66 and SEQ. ID.

Five transformants positive for both bands were taken forward for further analysis. </p><p> The five selected transformants were inoculated into a liquid medium containing 10 g/L yeast extract, 20 &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;g/L&lt;/RTI&gt; peptone, 50 g/L xylose (pH 6.5) and incubated at &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;35 C&lt;/RTI&gt; for 48 hours. 4 &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;gcdw&lt;/RTI&gt; of each was harvested by centrifugation and re- suspended in 50 ml 10 g/L yeast extract, 20 &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;g/L&lt;/RTI&gt; peptone, 50 &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;g/L&lt;/RTI&gt; xylose, 10 mM &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;MgCl2&lt;/RTI&gt; and 7.5 g/L CaC03. The flasks are put into production at &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;35 G&lt;/RTI&gt; and 70 rpm shaking. </p><p>Strain CD861 (Ex. 8B) is similarly cultivated to compare the effect of the &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;KmXYLI&lt;/RTI&gt; and &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;KmXYL2&lt;/RTI&gt; re-insertions. </p><p> Strain &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;CD861&lt;/RTI&gt; consumes essentially all the xylose in 30 hours, producing 16.1 g/L ethanol in that time. Ethanol yield for strain CD861 was 67%. The five &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;XR+,&lt;/RTI&gt; XDH+ transformants all consumed xylose much more slowly, and produced average ethanol yields of about 16%. Strain CD861 produced a xylitol yield of 10%, but the five transformants averaged a xylitol yield of &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;56%.&lt;/RTI&gt; Xylose reductase activity for strain CD861 was about 2 mU/mg, whereas it ranged from 126-425 &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;mU/mg&lt;/RTI&gt; in the transformants, after 73.5 hours cultivation. Xylitol dehydrogenase activity in strain CD861 was zero, but ranged from 21 to &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;98&lt;/RTI&gt; &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;mU/mg&lt;/RTI&gt; in the transformants after 73.5 hours cultivation. The increase in activities of these enzymes indicates that the reinserted KmXYLI and KmXYL2 genes were functional in the five transformants. </p><p>Xylose isomerase activity was higher in strain CD861 (-131 mU/mg) than in the five transformants (-26-45 mU/mg).

D. -not determined. </p><p> Xylulokinase and xylose isomerase activities for these samples were determined as follows: 
The samples (5-10 ml) were centrifuged and washed once with 100 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. After washing, the samples were resuspended into Y-PER yeast protein extraction reagent (Pierce, Rockford, IL) containing protease inhibitors (Complete Mini, EDTA free, Roche). After 20 minutes incubation at room temperature, the cells were centrifuged 13,000 rpm for 10 minutes at &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;+4 C.&lt;/RTI&gt; </p><p>Supernatant samples were collected for activity measurements. </p><p> Xylulokinase activity was determined by a two-step protocol. In step 1, the reaction contained 50 mM HEPES/KOH pH 7.5, 5 mM ATP, 6 mM &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;MgCl2&lt;/RTI&gt; and 20 mM xylulose. The background reaction was determined by adding water instead of xylose. </p><p>After adding the enzyme sample, the reactions were incubated at &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;30 C&lt;/RTI&gt; for 0 and 240 seconds. After the incubation the reactions were stopped by incubating them at &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;95 C&lt;/RTI&gt; for 5 min. After reaction was stopped 40 mM HEPES/KOH pH 7.5, 10 mM &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;MgCl2,&lt;/RTI&gt; 2.5 mM PEP and 0.2 mM NADH was added to the reaction and absorbance at 340 nm was measured. After measuring the initial absorbance, a mixture of myokinase, pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase was added. This reaction was incubated further for 1 hour and absorbance at 340 nm was measured. The xylulokinase activity was calculated from the ADP production during the assays. </p><p>&lt;Desc/Clms Page number 57&gt;</p><p> Xylose isomerase activity was determined by monitoring the oxidation of NADH at 340 nm at &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;30 C.&lt;/RTI&gt; The reaction contains (in addition to the sample) 100 mM &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;TES-NaOH,&lt;/RTI&gt; pH 7.0, 250 mM xylose, 10 mM &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;MgCl2,&lt;/RTI&gt; 0.6 mM NADH and 2.5 U sorbitol dehydrogenase. The background was detected by measuring the activity without xylose. The xylose isomerase assay was performed in a Cobas Mira automated analyzer (Roche). </p><p> Protein concentrations were determined with the Lowry method (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Lowry, O. H., Rosebrough, N. J. , Farr, A. L. and Randall, R. J. (1951), Protein measurement with the Folin phenol reagent, J. Biol. Chem. 193: 265-275</bibl>). Bovine serum albumin (Sigma) was used as a protein standard. </p><p>Example 14A: Microaerobic shake flask characterizations of wild-type C. sonorensis and strains &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;Cs/T-1,-25,-34,-51&lt;/RTI&gt; (Ex. 13E), Cs/417-201,-206,-208, &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;- 214 (Ex. &lt;/RTI&gt; 13F) and Cs/417-214/425A and-B (Ex. 13G) 
50 ml &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;of YP &lt;/RTI&gt; (10 g/L yeast extract and 20 g/L peptone) + 5% glucose + &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;10mM&lt;/RTI&gt; &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;MgCl2&lt;/RTI&gt; in 250 ml flasks was inoculated with cells grown on YPD plates and incubated overnight with 250 rpm shaking at &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;30 C.&lt;/RTI&gt; A 5 ml aliquot was removed for XI, XK and protein assays. &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;OD600&lt;/RTI&gt; was measured and an amount of cells equivalent of &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;OD600=12&lt;/RTI&gt; (corresponding to 4 g/L cell dry weight) &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;(OD6oo=40&lt;/RTI&gt; for strains Cs/417-214/425A and- B) in 50 ml was collected by centrifugation and resuspended in 50 ml of YP + &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;5%&lt;/RTI&gt; xylose + 10 mM &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;MgCl2.&lt;/RTI&gt; The resuspended cells were transferred into a 250 ml flask containing 1.2 g CaCOs. The cultures were incubated at &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;30 C&lt;/RTI&gt; &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;with-100&lt;/RTI&gt; rpm shaking. </p><p>Samples for HPLC (for measuring xylose consumption and ethanol, xylitol, acetate and xylulose production) and &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;OD600&lt;/RTI&gt; measurements were collected daily. The fermentation was carried out for approximately 11 days. </p><p> Strains &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;Cs/T-1,-25,-34-51&lt;/RTI&gt; and Cs/417-214/425A and-B produced 2-5 g/L ethanol, with xylitol being the main product for these strains. The wild-type C. sonorensis strain and strains Cs/417-201, -206,-208 and-214 did not produce ethanol under the microaerobic conditions. This indicates that both xylose isomerase and xylulokinase are needed for ethanol production under microaerobic conditions. All XR+ strains also produced acetate. </p><p> Strains Cs/417-201, -206,-208,-214 and Cs/417-214/425B consumed xylose slowly and no ethanol, xylitol or acetate was produced under these microaerobic conditions. Strain Cs/417-201/425A also consumed xylose slowly and produced some xylitol. At 11 days, strains Cs/417-206 and Cs/417-214 produced 0.7 and 1.2 g/L of xylulose, respectively. This suggests that under these microaerobic conditions, </p><p>&lt;Desc/Clms Page number 58&gt;</p><p> xylulose accumulated in XI+ strains that did not have overexpressed XK, and that the amount of xylulose accumulation depends on XI activity level. </p><p>Example 14B: Anaerobic shake flask characterizations of wild-type C. sonorensis and strains Cs/T-25,-34 (Ex. 13E), Cs/417-201, -214 (Ex. 13F), Cs/417-214/425A and B (Ex. 13G) 
50 ml of YP + 5% glucose +10 mM &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;MgClz&lt;/RTI&gt; in 250 ml flasks was inoculated with cells grown on YPD plates and incubated overnight with 250 rpm shaking at &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;30 C.&lt;/RTI&gt; A 5 ml aliquot was removed for XI, XK and protein assays. &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;OD600&lt;/RTI&gt; was measured and an amount of cells equivalent of OD600=12 (corresponding to 4 &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;g/L&lt;/RTI&gt; cell dry weight) &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;(OD6oo=40&lt;/RTI&gt; for strains Cs/417-214/425A &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;and-B)&lt;/RTI&gt; in 50 ml was collected by centrifugation and resuspended in 50 ml of YP + 5% xylose + 10 mM MgCl2 + 24 &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;g/L&lt;/RTI&gt; CaCOs. The cultures were incubated at &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;30 C&lt;/RTI&gt; with 100 rpm shaking in 100 ml shake flasks sealed with water locks. The cultivation was sampled. Samples for HPLC (for measuring xylose consumption and ethanol, xylitol, acetate and xylulose production) and &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;OD600&lt;/RTI&gt; measurements were collected periodically. The cultivation was continued for 15 days. </p><p> Strains Cs/T-25 and-34 produced 2 &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;g/L&lt;/RTI&gt; ethanol during the first 8 days of incubation whereas the wild-type C. sonorensis strain did not produce detectable ethanol. Strains Cs/417-201 and-214 also failed to produce ethanol under these conditions, indicating that both xylose isomerase and xylulokinase genes are needed to obtain anaerobic fermentation ability on xylose in these strains. </p><p> Strain Cs/417-214/425A produced-13 g/L ethanol after 4 days and-25 g/L ethanol after 11 days. Yield on xylose to ethanol was approximately 55% after 4 days and 53% after 11 days. Xylose consumption was 22-23 &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;g/L&lt;/RTI&gt; after 4 days and &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;48-49&lt;/RTI&gt; g/L after 11 days. Strain Cs/417-214/425B consumed-16 g/L of xylose in 4 days and produced 7 &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;g/L&lt;/RTI&gt; ethanol. This indicates that in these strains, disruption of the native &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;XR/XDH&lt;/RTI&gt; pathway combined with exogenous XI gene expression and XK overexpression is important to achieve good ethanol production. Disruption of both the &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;CsXR&lt;/RTI&gt; and &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;CsXDH&lt;/RTI&gt; genes is seen to provide the best ethanol production under anaerobic conditions. </p><p>&lt;Desc/Clms Page number 59&gt;</p><p>Example 14C: Microaerobic shake flask characterizations of LDH- producing C. sonorensis mutant strain 246-27 and strains C29/403-7 (Ex. 13H) and &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;C29/403-7/425&lt;/RTI&gt; (Ex. &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;13I)&lt;/RTI&gt; 
Microaerobic shake flask cultivations were performed for each of these three strains, using the general conditions described in Example 14A, except that lactate production was also monitored. </p><p> Under these microaerobic conditions, strain 246-27 and strain C29/403-7 consumed xylose at about 0.5 g/L/hr and all produced lactic acid at about 0.4 g/L/hr. </p><p>Strain C29/403-7/425 produced about 10-15% more lactic acid and about 10-15% less xylitol than strain C29/403-7 under these conditions. Strain C29/403-7 produced more xylulose than the others, suggesting that xylulose accumulates in this strain because of xylose isomerase activity. </p><p> At the end of the cultivations, cells from each flask are streaked onto YP + xylose and onto YP + glucose plates and incubated in anaerobe jars for 9 days. None grew anaerobically, but all grew aerobically in xylose and glucose media. </p><p>Example 14D: Anaerobic shake flask characterizations of LDH-producing C. sonorensis mutant strain 246-27 and strains C29/403-7 (Ex. 13H), C29/403- &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;7/425&lt;/RTI&gt; (Ex. &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;13I)&lt;/RTI&gt; and C29/417-9 (Ex. 13J) 
Anaerobic shake flask cultivations were performed for each of these three strains, using the general conditions described in Example 14B, except that lactate production was also monitored. </p><p> All consumed xylose at a rate of about 0.1 g/L/hr. Strains 246-27, C29/403-7, C29/403-7/425 and C29/417-9 produced 4.1, 4.8, 6.4 and 3.0 g/L of lactic acid, 0.3, 0.45, 0.3 and 0.3 &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;g/L&lt;/RTI&gt; xylitol and 0.3, 1.45, 0.9 and 0.85 g/L xylulose, respectively, after 141 hours. Under these conditions, the overexpression of the xylulokinase enzyme leads to improved lactic acid production. Strains with overexpressed xylose isomerase but without overexpressed xylulokinase accumulate xylulose, indicating that the xylose isomerase gene is active. </p><p>Example 14E: Microaerobic shake flask characterizations of LDH- producing C. sonorensis mutant strain 246-27 and strains C29/417-4 and-9 (Ex. 13J), C29/417-9/425-9 &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;and-11&lt;/RTI&gt; (Ex. &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;13K)&lt;/RTI&gt; 
Microaerobic shake flask cultivations were performed for each of these three strains, using the general conditions described in Example 14C. Cultivations were continued for 7 days. </p><p> Under these microaerobic conditions, strain 246-27 consumed xylose faster than the other strains. Strain C29/417-4, -9, C20/417-425-9 &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;and-11&lt;/RTI&gt; produced about </p><p>&lt;Desc/Clms Page number 60&gt;</p><p> 2-5 g/L lactic acid after 7 days, after which time 25-35 g/L residual xylose remained. </p><p>The ability of strain C29/417-9/425-11 to produce lactic acid confirms that the xylose isomerase and xylulokinase pathway is operative in these strains. Strain C29/417- 9/425-11 consumed xylose slightly faster than the C29/417-9/425-9 strain, but also accumulated 1-2 g/L xylitol. </p><p>Example 14F: Anaerobic shake flask characterizations of LDH-producing C. sonorensis mutant strains C29/417-9 (Ex. 13J), C29/417-9/425-9 and-11 (Ex. </p><p>13K) 
Anaerobic shake flask cultivations were performed for each of these three strains, using the general conditions described in Example 14D. </p><p> Strains C29/417-9, C29/417-9/425-9 and C29/417-9/425-11 produced 4.4, 6.2 and 24.4 g/L lactic acid after 146 hours. Yield of lactic acid on xylose was 0.40, 0.70 and 0.95 g/g, respectively for these strains. No xylitol was produced by either strain &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;C29/417-9/425-9&lt;/RTI&gt; or-11, whereas strain C29/417-9 produced 2.7 g/L xylitol. Under these conditions, the overexpression of the xylulokinase enzyme leads to improved lactic acid production. This indicates that in these strains, disruption of the native xylose reductase/xylitol dehydrogenase pathway combined with exogenous xylose isomerase and xylulokinase overexpression provides good lactic acid production. </p><p>Disruption of both the &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;CsXR&lt;/RTI&gt; &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;and CsXDH &lt;/RTI&gt; genes is seen to provide the best production under anaerobic conditions. </p><p>Example 15A: Generation of K. &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;marxianus&lt;/RTI&gt; mutant strains (CD1103 and CD1106) containing the Cyllamyces aberensis xylose isomerase (CaXYLA) gene 
Cyllamyces &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;aberensis&lt;/RTI&gt; DNA (isolate ffewl from cow, U. K. ) was obtained from Gareth Wyn &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;Griffith,&lt;/RTI&gt; Institute of Biological Sciences, University of Wales, Aberystwyth, Ceredigion SY23 3DA, Great Britain. PCR reactions were conducted using this DNA as the template, using 0.5 uM of the sense primer identified as SEQ. </p><p>ID. NO. 149 and 0.5 &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;pM&lt;/RTI&gt; of the antisense primer identified as SEQ. ID. NO. 150 Phusion HF buffer and 0.2 mM of each dNTP. In this construct, the first methionine encoded as detected at the 5'end sequence of the gene served as the initiation methionine, and an in-frame stop codon was included in addition to &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;SbfI&lt;/RTI&gt; restriction sites. Before 3 minutes denaturation, 2 U of Phusion polymerase (Finnzymes Oy, Espoo, Finland) was added. The reaction was cycles 35 times as follows: 10 seconds at &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;98 C,&lt;/RTI&gt; 30 seconds at &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;45 C&lt;/RTI&gt; and 1 minute at &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;72 C&lt;/RTI&gt; with a final extension of 8 minutes at &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;72 C.&lt;/RTI&gt; A 1346 bp PCR fragment was obtained and ligated to TOPO plasmid with </p><p>&lt;Desc/Clms Page number 61&gt;</p><p> the TOPO TA Cloning Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and sequenced. The C. aberensis xylose isomerase &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;(CaXYLA)&lt;/RTI&gt; gene has the nucleotide sequence identified as SEQ. ID. NO. 151. The deduced amino acid sequence for the protein encoded by this gene is given as SEQ. ID.

The K. marxianus Ura3 gene (KmURA3) gene plus about 750 bp of the Ura3 promoter region and about 250 bp to the Ura3 terminator region was isolated in a standard protocol using Failsafe Polymerase (Epicenter), with the genomic DNA as template and primers identified as SEQ. ID. </p><p>NO. 153 and SEQ. ID. NO. 154. PCR conditions were 5 minutes at &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;95 C,&lt;/RTI&gt; 15 cycles of 30 seconds at &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;95 C,&lt;/RTI&gt; 30 seconds at &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;55 C&lt;/RTI&gt; and 2 minutes at &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;68 C,&lt;/RTI&gt; followed by 25 cycles of 30 seconds at &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;95 C&lt;/RTI&gt; and 2.5 minutes at &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;68 C,&lt;/RTI&gt; ending in a blunt end generation cycle of &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;68 C&lt;/RTI&gt; for 8 minutes. The resulting-1. 8 kb PCR product was cloned into &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;pCR-XL-&lt;/RTI&gt; TOPO vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced for verification. The resulting plasmid was designated &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;pS090.&lt;/RTI&gt; The nucleotide sequence of the cloned &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;KmURA3&lt;/RTI&gt; gene appears as SEQ. ID. NO. 155. Plasmid &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;pS090&lt;/RTI&gt; is digested with &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;SphI&lt;/RTI&gt; and &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;the-1. 8 &lt;/RTI&gt; kbp KmURA3 region is gel isolated and ligated into a similarly digested and shrimp alkaline phosphatase &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;treated-4570&lt;/RTI&gt; bp fragment of plasmid pCM9 (Ex. &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;1I,&lt;/RTI&gt; Fig. 9). The resulting plasmid &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;(pS091,&lt;/RTI&gt; Fig. 35) contains the &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;KmURA3&lt;/RTI&gt; selection gene, the &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;KmPDC1&lt;/RTI&gt; promoter, a SbfI site and the ScCYCl terminator. </p><p> The CaXYLA-containing plasmid from above was digested and &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;a-1.&lt;/RTI&gt; 4 kbp fragment containing the &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;CaXYLA&lt;/RTI&gt; gene is gel isolated. Plasmid &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;pS091&lt;/RTI&gt; is similarly digested and shrimp alkaline phosphate treated to obtain a 6376 bp fragment.

The colonies were streaked onto secondary Sc-Ura plates, where all exhibited secondary growth. The transformants were screened by PCR for the presence of the intact KmURA3 gene (inserted with plasmid &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;pS099)&lt;/RTI&gt; with primers identified as SEQ. ID. NO. 156 and SEQ. ID.

CD1103 contains the &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;CaXYLA&lt;/RTI&gt; gene, an intact KmURA3 gene, and a disrupted &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;KmURA3&lt;/RTI&gt; gene. &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;CD1106&lt;/RTI&gt; contains the CaXYLA gene and the disrupted &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;Km URA3. &lt;/RTI&gt; </p><p>Example 15B: Anaerobic fermentation with strains CD1103 and CD1106 (Ex. </p><p>15A) 
Baffled shake flasks containing 100 ml of media (20 g/L yeast extract, 10 g/L peptone, 100 g/L glucose) were separately inoculated with strains CD1103 and 1106 were incubated overnight at &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;35 C&lt;/RTI&gt; and shaking at 250 rpm. Cells were harvested &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;after-14&lt;/RTI&gt; hours, and 4 g/L cell dry weight of each strain were added to separate 50 ml Falcon screw top tubes containing 45 ml yeast peptone, 50 g/L D-xylose, 7.5 g/L CaC03 and 10 mM &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;MgCl2.&lt;/RTI&gt; Tubes were cultivated anaerobically for 65 hours at &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;30 C&lt;/RTI&gt; with shaking at 70 rpm. Strain 1103 produced over 9 g/L of ethanol, and strain 1106 produced over 7 g/L ethanol in that time. XI activity was determined by lysing cells taken from the growth phase. XI activity was measured and found to be approximately &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;83&lt;/RTI&gt; mU/mg for each of strains 1103 and 1106. </p><p>Example 16A: Cloning &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;B.&lt;/RTI&gt; thetaiotaomicron xylose isomerase &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;(BtXYLA)&lt;/RTI&gt; gene (pS089, Fig. 37) 
Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron genomic DNA was obtained from Washington University (St. Louis, MO) Department of Molecular Biology and Pharmacology. The BtXLYA gene was isolated in a standard protocol using Pfx Polymerase (Stratagene), with the genomic DNA as template and primers identified as SEQ. ID. NO. 160 and SEQ. ID. NO. 161. PCR conditions were &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;95 C&lt;/RTI&gt; for 3 minutes; 15 cycles of 30 seconds at &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;95 C,&lt;/RTI&gt; 30 seconds at &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;60 C&lt;/RTI&gt; and 2 minutes at &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;68 C,&lt;/RTI&gt; followed by 20 cycles of 30 seconds at &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;95 C&lt;/RTI&gt; and 2.5 minutes at &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;68 C,&lt;/RTI&gt; ending in a blunt end generation cycle of &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;68 C&lt;/RTI&gt; for 8 minutes. The resulting-1. 4 kb PCR product was cloned into &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;pCR-XL-&lt;/RTI&gt; TOPO vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced for verification. The resulting plasmid was designated pS089 (Fig. 37). The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the cloned BtXYLA gene appear as SEQ. ID. NO. 162 and SEQ. ID. NO. 163, respectively. </p><p>Example 16B: Creation of plasmid containing &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;BtXYLA&lt;/RTI&gt; and &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;KmURA3&lt;/RTI&gt; selection gene plasmid (pS096, Fig. 38) 
The-1. 4 kb &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;BtXYLA&lt;/RTI&gt; gene was gel extracted from plasmid pS089 after an Sbfl digest and ligated to a similarly digested 6376bp fragment of plasmid &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;pS091&lt;/RTI&gt; (Ex. 16A, Fig. 35). The resulting plasmid (pS096, Fig. 38) contains the &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;KmURA3&lt;/RTI&gt; </p><p>&lt;Desc/Clms Page number 63&gt;</p><p> selection gene, the &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;BtXYLA&lt;/RTI&gt; gene under the control of the &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;KmPDC1&lt;/RTI&gt; promoter, and ScCYCl terminator. </p><p>Example 16C: Creation of K &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;marxianus&lt;/RTI&gt; mutants (CD1089-1096) by transforming a strain corresponding to CD806 (Ex. 6B) with plasmid pS096 (Ex. 16B, Fig. 38). </p><p> A &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;K.&lt;/RTI&gt; marxianus colony corresponding to CD 806 (Ex. 6B) is cultured. 20 ml of cells are spun down and transformed with plasmid pS096 using standard electroporation methods. Plasmid pS096 is digested with AatII and BsmBI prior to integration. 100 uL of cells were plated on Sc-Ura plates and allowed to grow at &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;37 C&lt;/RTI&gt; until colonies formed. The colonies were streaked onto secondary plates of SC-Ura. </p><p>The transformants were screened by PCR for the presence of the &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;intact KmURA3 &lt;/RTI&gt; gene with primers identified as SEQ. ID. NO. &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;156&lt;/RTI&gt; and SEQ. ID. NO. 157. A PCR screening for a-450 bp region upstream of the BtXYLA stop codon and just inside of the &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;ScCYC&lt;/RTI&gt; terminator is performed with primers identified as SEQ. ID. NO. 164 and SEQ. ID. NO. 165. Of the transformants testing positive for both the native &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;KmURA3&lt;/RTI&gt; and &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;BtXYLA&lt;/RTI&gt; gene, eight are selected and designated &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;CD1089-1096,&lt;/RTI&gt; respectively. </p><p> For determination of xylose isomerase activity, strains were grown at &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;30 C,&lt;/RTI&gt; 250 rpm &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;for-14&lt;/RTI&gt; hours &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;in YPD &lt;/RTI&gt; (10 &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;g/L&lt;/RTI&gt; yeast extract, 20 g/L peptone, 100 g/L dextrose). Cells were lysed according to protocol for Y-PER (Pierce &amp;num;78990). Total protein was determined using Advanced Protein Assay Reagent (Cysoskeleton &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;&amp;num;ADV01)&lt;/RTI&gt; with BSA as a standard. Xylose isomerase activities for strains CD 806 and &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;CD1089-1096&lt;/RTI&gt; are as follows:

The higher activities of CD1089 and CD1092 may be due to the integration of multiple copies of the &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;BtXYLA&lt;/RTI&gt; gene or a preferred site of integration. </p><p>&lt;Desc/Clms Page number 64&gt;</p><p>Example 16D: Shake flask characterisation of strains CD1089-1096 (Ex. 16C). </p><p> Single colonies of strains CD806, and CD1089-1096 were separately inoculated for growth in &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;100ml&lt;/RTI&gt; media consisting of 10 &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;g/L&lt;/RTI&gt; yeast extract, 20 &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;g/L&lt;/RTI&gt; peptone, and 100 &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;g/L&lt;/RTI&gt; dextrose. The cells were grown for 14 hours at &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;30 C,&lt;/RTI&gt; after which the cells were collected and cell dry weight determined. 1.4 g/L cell dry weight of each culture is added to separate 50 mL Falcon tubes containing lOg/L yeast extract, 20g/L peptone, 50g/L D-xylose, 7.5 &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;g/L&lt;/RTI&gt; &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;CaCO3,&lt;/RTI&gt; and &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;10mM&lt;/RTI&gt; &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;MgCl2.&lt;/RTI&gt; These cultures were incubated at &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;30 C&lt;/RTI&gt; with shaking at 70 rpm. Broth samples were taken for HPLC analysis approximately every 24 hours. After 72 hours, results of this anaerobic fermentation were as shown in the following table.

In microaerobic shake flask fermentation studies, strains &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;CD1089&lt;/RTI&gt; and &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;CD1092&lt;/RTI&gt; produced up to about 1 gram of ethanol after about 7 hours fermenting at &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;30 C&lt;/RTI&gt; and 70 rpm. </p><p> Strains &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;CD1089-1096&lt;/RTI&gt; were plated at the end of a low oxygen xylose cultivation onto YPX plates and placed in an anaerobic chamber for two days. All except CD 1095 exhibited anaerobic growth under these conditions, with strains &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;CD1089&lt;/RTI&gt; and &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;CD1092&lt;/RTI&gt; showing the greatest anaerobic growth. </p><p>Example 17: Shake-flask fermentation of strains CD804 (Ex. 4D), CD805 (Ex. </p><p>&lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;5E)&lt;/RTI&gt; and CD806 (Ex. 6B) in media with xylose and externally added commercial enzyme glucose isomerase 
Strains CD804, CD805 and CD806 were separately inoculated to an &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;OD600&lt;/RTI&gt; of 0.1 from YPD agar plates and were grown for 16 hours at &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;33 C&lt;/RTI&gt; with 250 rpm, in 250 </p><p>&lt;Desc/Clms Page number 65&gt;</p><p> mL baffled shake flasks containing 50 mL YPD supplemented with &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;50&lt;/RTI&gt; &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;ug/ml&lt;/RTI&gt; G418. </p><p>After determining that residual glucose remained in each flask and that the cells were consequently in exponential growth phase, 0.5 g/L cell dry weight equivalents of each strain were harvested by centrifugation and separately resuspended in 250 mL baffled shake flasks containing 47.5 mL YP supplemented with 50 g/L D-xylose. 2.5 ml glucose isomerase (Gensweet SGI; Genencor Inc. , CA) (also known as xylose isomerase) was added to the shake-flasks and the cultures were grown at &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;33 C&lt;/RTI&gt; with 70 rpm. For controls, 0.5 g/L cell dry weight equivalents of strains each of strains CD804,805 and 806 were separately resuspended in 250 mL baffled shake flasks containing 50 mL YP supplemented with 50 g/L D-xylose where the glucose isomerase was omitted. These shake-flasks were also incubated at &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;33 C&lt;/RTI&gt; with 70 rpm. </p><p>Samples were withdrawn at various time intervals and the cells were removed by filtration. Culture supernatant was analyzed for xylose, xylitol and ethanol by HPLC methods. </p><p> After 25 hours, strain CD804 (Ex. 4D) had consumed 15 g/L D-xylose and produced about 4.7 g/L of xylitol and 1 g/L of ethanol from the flask containing the glucose isomerase. In contrast, strains CD805 (Ex. 5C) and CD806 (Ex. 6B) had each consumed 25 g/L D-xylose in the presence of glucose isomerase. Strain CD805 produced in this time about 1.9 g/L of xylitol and 7.1 g/L of ethanol. Strain CD806 produced in this time about 1.8 g/L of xylitol and 6.8 g/L of ethanol. Xylulose seems to be consumed by the strains at very high rates, something which is not observed in S. &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;cerevisiae.&lt;/RTI&gt; The non-oxidative pentose phosphate pathway controls the fermentation rate of xylulose but not of xylose in &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;S.&lt;/RTI&gt; cerevisiae TMB3001. <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">FEM Yeast Res. 2002 Aug; 2 (3): &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;277-82.&lt;/RTI&gt; Johansson B, Hahn-Hagerdal B</bibl>). Without added glucose isomerase, each of strains CD804, &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;CD805&lt;/RTI&gt; and CD806 consumed xylose very slowly. </p><p>Example 18: Transformation of strain corresponding to CD806 (Ex. 6B) with self-replicating plasmid pCM48 (Fig. 40) to introduce PXYLA gene; cultivation of the resulting strains 
A cassette containing the &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;KmPDC1&lt;/RTI&gt; promoter, PXYLA gene and &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;ScCYCl&lt;/RTI&gt; terminator was PCR amplified using primers identified as SEQ. ID. NO. 166 and SEQ. ID. NO. 167, using plasmid pCM29 (Ex. 8A, Fig. 21) as the template. These primers were designed to incorporate Pad and &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;MluI&lt;/RTI&gt; restriction sites. Thermocycling conditions were an initial incubation of &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;94 C&lt;/RTI&gt; for 2 minutes, followed by 30 cycles of &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;94 C&lt;/RTI&gt; for 30 seconds, &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;50 C&lt;/RTI&gt; for 30 seconds, and &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;70 C&lt;/RTI&gt; for 3 minutes. This was followed </p><p>&lt;Desc/Clms Page number 66&gt;</p><p> by a final incubation at &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;70 C&lt;/RTI&gt; for 8 minutes. The product was digested with the above restriction enzymes and a 2.804 kbp fragment so obtained was ligated into fragment obtained by similarly digesting a plasmid designated pS057 (Fig. 39) (containing a pKD1 self-replication site), to yield the plasmid pCM48 (Fig. 40). The transformants were restriction mapped using EcoRI and &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;SbfI,&lt;/RTI&gt; and two were taken forward for sequencing. The entire PXYLA coding region was sequenced and verified to be identical for both transformants to the sequence on plasmid pCM29. </p><p> 2 &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;wog&lt;/RTI&gt; of undigested plasmid pCM48 was transformed into a strain corresponding to CD806 (Ex. 6B) using to standard electroporation methods. Cells were recovered for four hours in YPX, plated on YPX plates containing &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;300 jug/ml &lt;/RTI&gt; G418 and &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;150 gg/ml &lt;/RTI&gt; hygromycin and incubated at &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;37 C&lt;/RTI&gt; for 2 days. This produced a large number of transformants. Several transformants were re-streaked onto identical plates and incubated at &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;37 C&lt;/RTI&gt; for several days. Four transformants were selected and inoculated &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;into-100&lt;/RTI&gt; ml of YPX in a 250 &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;ml-baffled&lt;/RTI&gt; shake flask and incubated at &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;37 C&lt;/RTI&gt; with 250 rpm shaking. Strain CD861 was included and biomass prepared in the same manner. After 17 hours, 2 &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;gcdw&lt;/RTI&gt; of each was inoculated into separate 250 &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;ml-baffled&lt;/RTI&gt; shake flasks containing 50 mL media (10 g/L yeast extract, 20 g/L yeast peptone, 50 g/L xylose, 7.5 g/L CaCOs, 10 mM &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;MgCl2,&lt;/RTI&gt; and pH 7.0). The four transformants produced about 9-12.3 g/L ethanol after about 40 hours. The parent strain produced no ethanol. </p><p> 10 mL of the overnight culture was harvested by centrifugation and taken forward to enzyme assays. Xylose isomerase activities for the four transformants ranged from 456 to 531 &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;mU/mg.&lt;/RTI&gt;</p></description></fulltext-document>
