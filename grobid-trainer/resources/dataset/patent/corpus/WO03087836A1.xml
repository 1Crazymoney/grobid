 </p><p> METHOD OF &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;IDENTIFYING TRANSMEMBRANE PROTEIN-INTERACTING&lt;/RTI&gt;
COMPOUNDS FIELD OF THE INVENTION
This invention relates to methods for screening compounds for their ability to interact with transmembrane proteins. The invention further relates to methods for screening transmembrane proteins for their ability to dimerise or oligomerise into groups of two or more proteins. </p><p>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
In the description which follows, references are made to certain literature citations which are listed at the end of the specification and all of which are incorporated herein by reference. </p><p> Transmembrane proteins have been classified in several major classes, including G protein coupled receptors, transporters, tyrosine kinase receptors, cytokine receptors and LDL receptors. G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) can be grouped on the basis of structure and sequence homology into several families. Family 1 (also referred to as family A or the rhodopsin-like family) is by far the largest subgroup and contains receptors for small molecules such as the catecholamines, dopamine and noradrenaline, peptides such as the opioids, somatostatin and vasopressin, glycoprotein hormones such as thyrotropin stimulating hormone and the entire class of odorant molecules (George et al, 2002). Family 2 or family B contains the receptors such as for glucagon, parathyroid hormone and secretin. These GPCRs are characterised by a long amino terminus that contains several cysteines, which may form disulphide bridges. Family 3 or family C contains receptors such as the metabotropic glutamate, the Ca2+-sensing and the gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) B receptors. These receptors are also characterised by a complex amino terminus. Although all GPCRs share the seven membrane-spanning helices, the various GPCR families show no sequence homology to one another. </p><p> GPCRs are the &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;largest&lt;/RTI&gt; known group of cell-surface mediators of signal transduction and are present in every cell in the body. GPCR action regulates </p><p>&lt;Desc/Clms Page number 2&gt;</p><p> the entire spectrum of physiological functions, such as those involving the brain, heart, kidney, lung, immune and endocrine systems. Extensive efforts during the past decade has identified a large number of novel GPCRs, including multiple receptor subtypes for previously known ligands, and numerous receptors for which the endogenous ligands are as yet unidentified, &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;termed'orphan'receptors&lt;/RTI&gt; or oGPCRs (Lee et al., 2001; Lee et al., 2002; Bailey et al., 2001). </p><p> GPCRs have been the successful targets of numerous drugs for diverse disorders in clinical use today, with an estimated 50% of the current drug market targeting these molecules. Among the known &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;GPCRs,-335&lt;/RTI&gt; receptors are potential drug development targets, of which 195 have known ligands, and the remaining 140 being oGPCRs, awaiting identification of their ligands. Although various methodological advances have accelerated the pace of novel receptor discovery, the pace of ligand and drug discovery lags far behind. Conventional, small-scale pharmacological screening assay methods were initially used to discover the ligands and drugs for many of the GPCRs, but newer assay procedures are continually being sought. </p><p> Since GPCRs form over 80% of cell surface receptors, they represent a substantial resource and constitute a highly relevant group of protein targets for novel drug discovery. Drugs interacting with GPCRs have the potential to be highly selective, as the interactions will be confined to the cell surface and to tissues bearing the receptors exclusively. The convergence of the discovery of GPCRs with the realisation that they are important drug targets, has led to intense pharmaceutical interest in devising better ways to detect and screen for compounds interacting with GPCRs. Therefore, creating improved assay methods is an urgent requirement towards the goal of more rapid drug screening and discovery. There is a need to optimise the ability to detect an interaction between test compounds and the receptors, which is the fundamental initial step in the process of drug development. </p><p> Improved ligand-identification strategies to accelerate the characterisation of all GPCRs will define their physiological functions and realise their potential in discovering novel drugs. Even with the identified GPCRs, there is a paucity of highly selective subtype specific drugs being discovered and pharmaceutical </p><p>&lt;Desc/Clms Page number 3&gt;</p><p> houses are experiencing a dearth of promising lead compounds, in spite of the wealth of drug targets defined. The list of new drug product approvals by the top 20 pharmaceutical companies has declined considerably over the period 1999- 2001, compared to the preceding three year period (Smith, 2002). Thus there is a real need to have improved, versatile assay systems, where not just endogenous ligands, but novel compounds interacting with receptors can be tested and identified in a quick and efficient manner that is amenable to automation. </p><p> As the signal transduction pathway required to activate an &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;oGPCR&lt;/RTI&gt; cannot be predicted, an assay system for interacting compounds which is independent of prior predictions of which effector system (such as adenylyl cyclase, PLC, &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;cGMP,&lt;/RTI&gt; phosphodiesterase activity) is employed by the receptor is required. </p><p>Assigning ligands to GPCRs and oGPCRs is an important task; however the diversity of both GPCR ligands and effector systems can limit the utility of some existing ligand-identification assays, requiring novel approaches to drug discovery. </p><p> Recently, several methods utilising refined assay systems testing tissue extracts, large ligand libraries and specific ligands of interest have successfully discovered the endogenous ligands for a number of these oGPCRs. Such methods have been collectively referred to as"Reverse Pharmacology" (Howard et &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;al.,&lt;/RTI&gt; 2001). Various methods have been used to assay induced cell activity in response to an agonist compound, including the Fluorescence Imaging Plate Reader assay (FLIPR, Molecular Devices Corp., Sunnyvale, Calif.) and Barak et &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;al.,&lt;/RTI&gt; (1997), and <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">U. S. Patents Nos. 5,891, 646 and 6,110, 693</bibl> which disclose the use of a &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;ss-arrestin-green&lt;/RTI&gt; fluorescent fusion protein for imaging arrestin translocation to the cell surface upon stimulation of a GPCR. </p><p> The potential disadvantages of such methods are as follows : 1) visualisation is not of the receptor; 2) the protein translocation requires complex computerised analytical technologies; 3) prior identification of agonist is necessary to screen for antagonists; and 4) specific G protein coupling is necessary to generate a signal. </p><p>&lt;Desc/Clms Page number 4&gt;</p><p> Mechanisms of ligand binding and signal transduction by GPCRs traditionally have been modelled on the assumption that monomeric receptors participate in the process, and a monomeric model for GPCRs has been generally accepted. Since the mid-1990s, however, numerous reports have demonstrated oligomerisation of many GPCRs (reviewed by George et &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;al.,&lt;/RTI&gt; 2002), and it is now realised that oligomerisation is an inherent aspect of GPCR structure and biology. Also certain receptor subtypes formed hetero-oligomers, and these receptors have functional characteristics that differ from homogeneous receptor populations. At present, studies of GPCR oligomerisation do not make a distinction between dimers and larger complexes, and the term dimer is used interchangeably with the terms oligomer and multimer. There are no conclusive data to indicate how large the oligomers of functional GPCRs are. Importantly, generation of new properties through hetero-oligomerisation suggested a mechanism for generating diversity of function among GPCRs. </p><p>&lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;Homooligomerisation&lt;/RTI&gt; of GPCRs is accepted as a universal occurrence and a number of GPCRs are known to assemble as heterooligomeric receptor complexes (George et &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;al.,&lt;/RTI&gt; 2002). For example, the &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;GABA-B1&lt;/RTI&gt; and GABA-B2 receptors are not functional individually and only form a functional receptor when co-expressed (White et &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;al.,&lt;/RTI&gt; 1998). The assembly of &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;heterooligomer&lt;/RTI&gt; receptor complexes can result in novel receptor-ligand binding, signaling or intracellular trafficking properties. For example, co-transfection of the mu and delta opioid receptors resulted in the formation of oligomers with functional properties that were distinct from each of the receptors individually (George et &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;al.,&lt;/RTI&gt; &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;(2000)).&lt;/RTI&gt; The interaction of mu and delta opioid receptors to form oligomers generated novel pharmacological and G protein coupling properties. When mu and delta opioid receptors were co-expressed, the highly selective agonists (DAMGO, DPDPE, and morphine) had reduced potency and altered rank order, whereas certain endogenous ligands &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;endomorphin-1&lt;/RTI&gt; and Leu-enkephalin had enhanced affinity, suggesting the formation of a novel ligand binding pocket (George et &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;al.,&lt;/RTI&gt; 2000). </p><p>In contrast to the individually expressed mu and delta receptors, the coexpressed receptors showed pertussis toxin insensitive signal transduction, likely due to interaction with a different subtype of G protein. It would therefore be very </p><p>&lt;Desc/Clms Page number 5&gt;</p><p> useful, from the point of view of identification of potential drug targets, to have a means of determining whether a particular pair of GPCRs are able to form &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;heterooligomers.&lt;/RTI&gt; </p><p> In many reports, &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;heterooligomers&lt;/RTI&gt; have been tentatively identified by the ability to &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;co-immunoprecipitate.&lt;/RTI&gt; When two GPCRs are shown to co- immunoprecipitate, however, there are two possible interpretations; either the receptors are directly physically interacting, or both are interacting through contact with a common third protein (or proteins). An alternative approach to detecting receptor oligomers has been the development of energy transfer assays using &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;bioluminescent&lt;/RTI&gt; resonance energy transfer (BRET) or fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). Although these methods detect energy transfer between two receptor molecules labelled by &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;fluorophores&lt;/RTI&gt; at proximities of less than 100 angstroms, it is unclear whether receptor conformational changes can be reliably distinguished from de novo oligomerisation. </p><p> Transporters are protein pumps that move molecules, ions and other chemicals in and out of cells and exist in virtually all cells. The transporters can be grouped into families on the basis of structure, sequence homology and the molecules they transport. Separate transporters exist for monoamine neurotransmitters such as dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine and GABA, for amino acids such as glycine, taurine, proline and glutamate, &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;for vesicular&lt;/RTI&gt; monoamines, acetylcholine and GABA/glycine, for sugars such as glucose and disaccharides, for organic cations and organic anions, for oligopeptides and peptides, for fatty acids, bile acids, nucleosides, for water and for creatine. Pumps that export large molecules such as drugs, toxins and antibiotics from the cell are exemplified by the P-glycoprotein &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;(multidrug&lt;/RTI&gt; resistance protein) family. There are also several related transporters the function of which remains unknown (Masson et &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;al.,&lt;/RTI&gt; 1999). These transporters are membrane proteins consisting of a polypeptide generally with 12 transmembrane domains. The glutamate and aspartate transporters belong to a separate family whose members have 6 to 10 TM domains and share no homology to the other transporters (Masson et &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;al.,&lt;/RTI&gt; 1999). Both the amino and carboxyl termini are located on the intracellular side of the membrane. </p><p>&lt;Desc/Clms Page number 6&gt;</p><p> A large number of neurological and psychiatric disorders including depression, Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, drug addiction, Tourette's syndrome, and attention deficit disorders are considered to involve the monoamine transporters. The dopamine transporter (DAT) is the major target for psychostimulants such as cocaine and methylphenidate. The transporters have been the successful targets of numerous drugs for diverse disorders in clinical use today, particularly antidepressant drugs, including fluoxetine, &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;sertraline&lt;/RTI&gt; and the other related serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;(SSRIs).&lt;/RTI&gt; Although methodological molecular advances have identified the known transporters, the pace of ligand and drug discovery lags behind. </p><p>Conventional, pharmacological screening assay methods were used to discover the ligands and drugs for some of the transporters, but newer assay procedures are urgently being sought. Improved ligand-identification strategies to accelerate the characterisation of all the transporters will further define their physiological functions and realise their potential in discovering novel drugs. Even with the identified transporters, there is a paucity of highly selective specific drugs being discovered. </p><p> The tyrosine kinase receptor family members are characterised by their structural similarity, with an &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;extracellular&lt;/RTI&gt; ligand binding domain, a single transmembrane domain and an intracellular domain with tyrosine kinase activity for signal transduction. There are many subfamilies of receptor tyrosine kinases, exemplified by the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (also called HER1 or &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;erbB1),&lt;/RTI&gt; which is one of four members of such a subfamily, which also includes HER2, HER3 and HER4. The principal EGF-R ligands are EGF, &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;TGF-a,&lt;/RTI&gt; heparin binding EGF, amphiregulin, &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;betacellulin&lt;/RTI&gt; and epiregulin (Shawver et &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;al.,&lt;/RTI&gt; 2002). Activation of the EGF-R causes the receptor to dimerise with either another EGF-R monomer or another member of the HER subfamily. Marked diversity of ligand binding and signaling is generated by the formation of heterodimers among family members (Yarden and Sliwkowski, 2001). The EGF-R is widely expressed in a variety of tissues and mediates important functions such as cell growth and tissue repair. </p><p>Overexpression of EGF-R occurs in many types of cancer, such as head and </p><p>&lt;Desc/Clms Page number 7&gt;</p><p> neck, lung, laryngeal, esophageal, gastric, pancreatic, colon, renal, bladder, breast, ovarian, cervical, prostate, thyroid, &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;melanoma&lt;/RTI&gt; and glioma, and correlates with a poor outcome (Nicholson et &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;al.,&lt;/RTI&gt; 2001). Therefore there is great interest and need for developing drugs targeting the EGF-R and for methods which assist in identifying such drugs. </p><p> Other subfamilies of receptor tyrosine kinases are exemplified by the receptors for vascular endothelial factor (four members) and &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;fibroblast&lt;/RTI&gt; growth factor (four members). These have important roles in angiogenesis and also have significant roles in the uncontrolled proliferation of vessels characterizing carcinogenesis (Hanahan and Folkman. 1996). </p><p> The cytokine receptors are proteins spanning the membrane with an extracellular ligand binding domain and an intracellular domain with intrinsic kinase activity or adapter regions able to interact with intracellular kinases. </p><p>The receptors are divided into subclasses based on their structural complexity. &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;The'simple'receptors&lt;/RTI&gt; are those including receptors for growth hormone, erythropoietin and interleukins, and the'complex'receptors include the tumour necrosis factor receptor family, the 4-helical cytokine receptor family, the insulin/insulin-like receptor family and granulocyte colony stimulating receptor (Grotzinger, 2002). </p><p> The insulin and insulin-like growth factor &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;(IGF)&lt;/RTI&gt; receptor family controls metabolism, reproduction and growth (Nakae et &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;al.,&lt;/RTI&gt; 2001). There are nine different insulin-like peptides known and there are three known receptors that interact with them, &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;IR,&lt;/RTI&gt; &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;IGF-1&lt;/RTI&gt; R and IGF-2R, and an orphan member IR-related receptor. Each receptor exists as homodimers on the cell surface or heterodimers. The IR subfamily is also related to the EGF-R family. </p><p> IR, produced from a single &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;mRNA,&lt;/RTI&gt; undergoes cleavage and dimerisation and translocation to the plasma membrane. Each monomer component contains a single transmembrane domain; the complete receptor comprised two a and two &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt; &lt;/RTI&gt; subunits, linked by disulphide bridges. The &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt; &lt;/RTI&gt; subunit contains the single TM and the intracellular region. This receptor is a tyrosine kinase that catalyzes the phosphorylation of several intracellular substrates. </p><p> The low density lipoprotein (LDL) -receptor family act as cargo </p><p>&lt;Desc/Clms Page number 8&gt;</p><p> tranporters, regulating the levels of lipoproteins and proteases (Strickland et &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;al.,&lt;/RTI&gt; 2002). There are nine recognised members of the family, all of which share structural similarity, including an &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;extracellular&lt;/RTI&gt; region, a single transmembrane domain region and a cytoplasmic tail. The LDL receptor plays a major role in the clearance of lipoproteins, and genetic defects in the LDL receptor can result in the accumulation of LDL in the bloodstream. </p><p> The first characterised motif shown to be able to direct protein nuclear importation was exemplified by the amino acid sequence (PKKKRKV) contained in the SV40 large T antigen protein. The nuclear localisation sequence (NLS) motifs are recognised by the importin &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;a- &lt;/RTI&gt; receptor complex, which binds the NLS (Gorlich et &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;al.,&lt;/RTI&gt; 1996). These are cytosolic proteins, which recognise NLS containing proteins and transport these proteins to dock at the nuclear pore. The entire complex subsequently docks at the nuclear pore complex (Weis et &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;al.,&lt;/RTI&gt; 1998, &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;Schlenstedt et al.,&lt;/RTI&gt; 1996), contained at the nuclear envelope. The nuclear envelope is a boundary containing pores that mediate the nuclear transport process (Weis et &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;al.,&lt;/RTI&gt; 1998). </p><p> There have been very few and rare reports of GPCRs localising in the nucleus. One such example is the GPCR angiotensin type 1 &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;(AT1)&lt;/RTI&gt; receptor, which contains an endogenous NLS which serves to direct the GPCR into the nucleus (Lu et &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;al.,&lt;/RTI&gt; 1998), providing evidence that this NLS sequence was involved in the nuclear targeting of the AT1 receptor. These authors and Chen et &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;al.,&lt;/RTI&gt; (2000) reported that AT1 receptors increased in the nucleus in response to agonist. The nuclear localisation of the parathyroid hormone receptor has been reported (Watson et al, 2000). However very few of the superfamily of GPCRs contain an endogenous NLS mediating translocation of the receptor to the nucleus. </p><p> There therefore remains a need for new, more convenient methods for identifying compounds which interact with transmembrane proteins such as GPCRs, transporters, etc. There also remains a need for improved, less ambiguous methods for detecting oligomerisation of transmembrane proteins. </p><p>&lt;Desc/Clms Page number 9&gt;</p><p>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION 
The inventors have shown that the incorporation of a nuclear localisation sequence (NLS) into a transmembrane protein (not containing an endogenous functional NLS) routes the protein from the cell surface into the nucleus of a cell in a time-dependent and ligand-independent manner. In order to visualise this trafficking of transmembrane proteins from the cell surface, they carry a detectable moiety for visualisation by a variety of means. It has been demonstrated that membrane proteins from diverse protein families containing a synthetically incorporated NLS are redistributed under basal conditions from the cell surface to and towards the nucleus. </p><p> This process can be exploited to identify compounds which interact with transmembrane proteins by determining whether candidate compounds are able to modulate this ligand-independent transfer of a transmembrane protein away from the cell membrane. </p><p> It is also now possible, using methods based on this process, to determine whether protein molecules are able to oligomerise. </p><p> In accordance with one embodiment, the invention provides a method for screening a candidate compound for its ability to interact with at least one transmembrane protein comprising: transfecting a cell with at least one nucleotide sequence encoding a protein comprising a transmembrane protein containing at least one nuclear localisation sequence (NLS) and a detectable moiety and permitting expression of the encoded protein in the cell ; contacting the cell with a candidate compound; and determining the distribution of the expressed protein in the cell by detecting the distribution of the detectable moiety in the cell ; wherein detection of an altered distribution of the detectable moiety in the cell relative to the distribution of the detectable moiety in a control cell not contacted with the candidate compound indicates that the compound interacts with the transmembrane protein. </p><p>&lt;Desc/Clms Page number 10&gt;</p><p> In accordance with a further embodiment of this method, the cell is contacted with a compound known to interact with the at least one transmembrane protein prior to contacting the cell with the candidate compound and wherein detection of an altered distribution of the detectable moiety in the cell relative to the distribution of the detectable moiety in a control cell contacted with the compound known to interact with the transmembrane protein but not contacted with the candidate compound indicates that the candidate compound interacts with the transmembrane protein. </p><p> In accordance with a further embodiment, the invention provides a method for screening a candidate compound for its ability to interact with at least one transmembrane protein comprising: transfecting a cell with at least one nucleotide sequence encoding an NLS-containing transmembrane protein and permitting expression of the encoded protein in the cell ; contacting the cell with a candidate compound; and determining the level of NLS-containing transmembrane protein remaining at the cell membrane by isolating the cell membrane fraction of the cell, contacting the fraction with a labelled ligand of the transmembrane protein and determining the level of binding of the ligand to the fraction; wherein detection of an altered level of the transmembrane protein at the cell membrane relative to the level at the cell membrane in a control cell not contacted with the candidate compound indicates that the compound interacts with the transmembrane protein. </p><p> In accordance with a further embodiment, the invention provides an isolated cell transfected with at least one nucleotide sequence encoding a protein comprising a transmembrane protein containing at least one NLS and a detectable moiety. </p><p> In accordance with a further embodiment, the invention provides a method for determining whether a first protein and a second protein are able to oligomerise comprising: </p><p>&lt;Desc/Clms Page number 11&gt;</p><p> transfecting a cell with a first nucleotide sequence encoding a first protein containing an NLS and a second nucleotide sequence encoding a second protein comprising a detectable moiety and permitting expression of the encoded first and second proteins in the cell ; and determining the distribution of the detectable moiety in the cell ; wherein detection of the detectable moiety in or adjacent to the nucleus of the cell or detection of a reduced level of the detectable moiety at the cell surface, relative to a control cell, indicates that the first and second proteins interact. </p><p>SUMMARY OF THE DRAWINGS

The invention provides, in one embodiment, a new and convenient method for screening candidate compounds for their ability to interact with a transmembrane protein. </p><p>&lt;Desc/Clms Page number 12&gt;</p><p> As used herein, when a candidate compound and a transmembrane protein"interact", this means that the compound is a ligand of the transmembrane protein and binds to the protein or is able to modulate the trafficking of the transmembrane protein away from the cell membrane described herein. </p><p> Identification of compounds which interact with a transmembrane protein is the first important step in the process of identifying lead compounds for drug development. </p><p> Working initially with GPCRs, the inventors have found that when a nucleated eukaryotic cell is transfected with a nucleotide sequence which encodes a GPCR containing a synthetically incorporated NLS, or a naturally occurring NLS, and the cell is permitted to express the nucleotide sequence, the expressed GPCR travels first to the cell membrane and then is transferred to the cell nucleus. This process is independent of ligand activation and takes from about 6 to about 72 hours, depending on the transmembrane protein involved, with an average of 24 to 48 hours. This is in contrast to the situation when a GPCR not containing an NLS is expressed in a cell, when the expressed GPCR remains predominantly at the cell surface, with small amounts occurring in the cytoplasm but no detectable amounts in the nucleus. </p><p> The inventors have also found that the transfer or trafficking of the expressed NLS-containing GPCR from the cell membrane to or towards the nucleus can be modulated by treating the transfected cell with a compound which interacts with the GPCR. Screening of candidate compounds for their ability to interact with a GPCR can therefore be carried out by detecting this modulation of transfer of the expressed GPCR from the cell membrane to the nucleus. </p><p> The inventors have further found that these observations are widely applicable to transmembrane proteins generally, and are not limited to GPCRs. </p><p> "Transmembrane protein"as used herein means a single chain protein found in the cell membrane and having at least one domain that spans the cell membrane. </p><p> The inventors have shown that a wide variety of transmembrane proteins from several families of the GPCR group, from the transporter group, from the </p><p>&lt;Desc/Clms Page number 13&gt;</p><p> cytokine receptor group, from the tyrosine kinase group and from the low density lipoprotein receptor group, if expressed in a nucleated cell so that they contain an NLS group, all show initial accumulation of the expressed protein at the cell membrane, followed by ligand activation-independent transfer of the expressed protein away from the cell membrane and into the cell nucleus. </p><p> The wide applicability of the methods of the invention is indicated by the immense variety of transmembrane protein structures represented by the exemplified transmembrane proteins used in the method; NLS insertion into a transmembrane protein resulting in translocation of the protein off the cell surface and to the nucleus has been shown to be effective with membrane proteins having one transmembrane (TM) domain, seven TM domains and twelve TM domains and sharing little or no sequence homology. </p><p> It has been found that the method of the invention is widely applicable to identifying compounds which interact with transmembrane proteins. </p><p> Compounds which interact with transmembrane proteins have been found to modulate their transfer from cell membrane to nucleus in different ways, including inhibition of the transfer, acceleration of the transfer and interference with the modulation produced by other compounds. Any interacting compound is of interest as a potential drug candidate. </p><p> Modulation of the transfer of expressed transmembrane protein is determined by comparing the distribution of the transmembrane protein within the cell in control cells and cells treated with a candidate compound. </p><p> In one embodiment, the method provides a convenient tool for screening candidate compounds for their ability to interact with a GPCR and modulate its trafficking. Compounds that specifically interact with the GPCR may inhibit or prevent transfer of the GPCR from the cell surface to the nucleus and may be antagonists to the GPCR, whereas other compounds can accelerate the transfer of GPCR to the nucleus, relative to a control cell and may be agonists to the GPCR. </p><p> To allow determination of the distribution of the expressed transmembrane protein within the cell, with and without exposure to a test compound, the expressed transmembrane protein must carry a detectable moiety, which can be </p><p>&lt;Desc/Clms Page number 14&gt;</p><p> detected in the cell. The detectable moiety may be any moiety which will remain associated with transmembrane protein throughout its expression and trafficking within the cell and can be directly or indirectly detected to determine its distribution within the cell and to determine an altered distribution resulting from exposure to a candidate compound. </p><p> In a first embodiment, the cell is transfected with a nucleotide sequence encoding a fusion protein comprising a transmembrane protein containing at least one NLS linked to a detectable moiety comprising a detectable peptide or polypeptide. As used herein, a peptide means a sequence of two to 20 amino acid residues, preferably a sequence of about 5 to about 15 amino acid residues, and a polypeptide means a sequence of more than 20 amino acid residues, including full proteins of any length. The detectable peptide or polypeptide may be directly detectable or may be reactable to give a detectable signal. The detectable peptide may be, for example, an antigenic peptide or epitope which is expressed, for example, at the amino terminus of the transmembrane protein. </p><p>The distribution of the transmembrane protein within the cell is detected by detection of the epitope using a detectable antibody specific for the epitope. A number of suitable epitope antibody systems are available commercially. </p><p>Examples are the HA (Roche Diagnostics), FLAG (Sigma Chemical Co. ), c-myc (Santa Cruz), Histidine hexamer (BD Biosciences &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;Clontech),&lt;/RTI&gt; GST (ABR Affinity BioReagents), V5 (Abcam) and Xpress &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;(Invitrogen)&lt;/RTI&gt; &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;epitope/antibody&lt;/RTI&gt; systems. </p><p> Nucleotide sequences encoding these epitopes can be purchased, as well as antibodies specific for the epitopes. These antibodies may carry a detectable label (e. g. fluorescein isothiocyanate &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;(FITC))&lt;/RTI&gt; or may themselves be detected by use of a second antibody carrying a detectable label, as will be understood by those of skill in the art. This embodiment of the invention is particularly adaptable to an automated or semi-automated method, for example by examining antibody-treated plates of cells in an automated plate reader, allowing for high through put screening. </p><p> The detectable polypeptide may be an optically detectable polypeptide such as green fluorescent protein (GFP), red fluorescent protein (RFP), yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) and or cyan fluorescent protein (CFP), or any of the </p><p>&lt;Desc/Clms Page number 15&gt;</p><p> modified variants of these proteins, which are commercially available. The detectable polypeptide may also be an enzyme such as luciferase or &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;p-&lt;/RTI&gt; &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;galactosidase,&lt;/RTI&gt; which can be reacted to give a detectable end point such as light emission or colour change. Nucleotide sequences encoding such polypeptides are readily available, for example from Clontech, and are linked to the nucleotide sequence encoding the NLS-containing transmembrane protein, preferably at the C-terminal end of that protein. </p><p> In a further embodiment, the detectable moiety is an antigenic peptide comprising a portion of the amino acid sequence of the transmembrane protein itself, preferably a portion of an &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;extracellular&lt;/RTI&gt; region of the protein. As described above, the distribution of the transmembrane protein within the cell is determined using a detectable antibody specific for the epitope. </p><p>Suitable antibodies are available commercially, e. g. anti-D1 antibody directed to amino terminal amino acids 9-21 of the human D1 dopamine receptor, or may be prepared by conventional methods. </p><p> In a further embodiment, applicable to transmembrane proteins with known ligands, the cell is transfected with a nucleotide sequence encoding a transmembrane protein containing at least one NLS. The cells are contacted with a candidate compound and incubated as described above. The cells are then harvested and the cell membrane fraction is isolated and contacted with a detectably labelled ligand of the transmembrane protein, for example a radio- labelled ligand. Determination of the amount of labelled ligand bound to the membrane fraction of treated cells, relative to the amount bound to the membrane fraction of control cells not contacted with the candidate compound, can be used to quantitate the transmembrane protein remaining at the cell surface and indicate interaction of the candidate compound with the transmembrane protein. </p><p> Transmembrane protein-encoding nucleotide sequences can be obtained from public databases such as Genbank (http &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;://www. ncbi. nlm.&lt;/RTI&gt; nih. gov: &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;80/entrez)&lt;/RTI&gt; or from commercial databases. </p><p>Suitable constructs may be synthesised by conventional methods, as described in the examples herein, or obtained commercially. </p><p>&lt;Desc/Clms Page number 16&gt;</p><p> "An NLS-containing transmembrane protein"includes a transmembrane protein which contains an NLS in its wild type sequence and a transmembrane protein whose amino acid sequence has been modified to contain an NLS. </p><p> Conventional NLSs are short peptide sequences that facilitate nuclear localisation of the proteins containing them (see for example, Table 1 which lists NLSs and Jans et &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;al.,&lt;/RTI&gt; 2000). There are three major classes of NLSs ; two of these classes consist of basic amino acid residues, the monopartite NLSs, exemplified by the SV40 large tumor antigen, PKKKRKV, consisting of a single stretch of basic amino acids, and the bipartite NLSs which contain two stretches of basic amino acids separated by 10 to 22 (sometimes up to hundreds) amino acids. Other types of NLSs are exemplified by those of the yeast protein Mata2 NLS where charged/polar residues are contained within the stretch of non-polar residues, or the protooncogene c-myc NLS, where proline and aspartic acid residues flanking the basic residues are required (PAAKRVKLD) for nuclear targeting. All classes of NLS are recognized specifically by the &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;a-p-importins.&lt;/RTI&gt; </p><p> Any NLS may be employed in the methods of the invention. </p><p>Nucleotide sequences encoding a selected NLS may be derived from the amino acid sequence of the NLS and are synthesised and incorporated into the nucleotide sequence encoding the transmembrane protein by conventional methods, as described herein. Many different locations within any of the intracellular loops or intracellular termini of the transmembrane protein are suitable for insertion of the NLS. Insertion of the NLS within an intracellular domain of the protein is preferred. For example, in a GPCR, the NLS could be placed in any of the &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;intracellular&lt;/RTI&gt; loops or intracellular carboxyl tail. In a 12 TM transporter, the NLS could be placed in the intracellular amino or carboxyl termini or any of the intracellular loops. </p><p> When an NLS is inserted into a transmembrane protein for use in the methods of the invention, the efficacy of the insertion can be screened by confirming that the NLS-containing transmembrane protein is substantially translocated from the cell membrane to the cell nucleus within 24 to 48 hours </p><p>&lt;Desc/Clms Page number 17&gt;</p><p> and that ligands of the transmembrane protein interfere with the translocation. </p><p> Nucleotide sequences encoding NLS-containing transmembrane proteins are linked to sequences encoding detectable peptides or polypeptides by conventional methods. </p><p> A nucleotide sequence encoding a selected NLS-containing transmembrane protein containing or linked to a detectable moiety, is transfected into a nucleated cell by cloning the sequence into a vector system containing a suitable promoter, using conventional techniques as described in the scientific literature, for example in Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;(1987).&lt;/RTI&gt; Suitable vectors include the pEGF-N1 (Clontech) which contains the human cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter, and the vector pcDNA. </p><p> Any cell may be used which is capable of expressing the transfected nucleotide sequences and in which an NLS facilitates transfer of a transmembrane protein away from the cell membrane. Suitable cells include prokaryotic cells, including bacterial cells, and eukaryotic cells. Suitable eukaryotic cells include isolated mammalian cells, yeast cells, plant cells, insect cells, nematode cells and fungal cells. Suitable mammalian cells include human cell lines, rodent cell lines, hamster cell lines, non-human primate cell lines. </p><p> In one embodiment, the cell is transfected with a number of nucleotide sequences, each encoding a different NLS-containing transmembrane protein and a different detectable moiety. Interference with trafficking of the transmembrane protein away from the cell membrane by a test compound can be related to interaction of the compound with a particular transmembrane protein by the identity of the detectable moiety whose movement from the cell surface is interrupted. </p><p> In a further embodiment, for higher throughput initial screening, the cell is transfected with a greater number of nucleotide sequences, each encoding a different NLS-containing transmembrane protein and a detectable moiety, some of the detectable moieties being common to more </p><p>&lt;Desc/Clms Page number 18&gt;</p><p> than one transmembrane protein. If initial screening indicates that a candidate compound is interacting with one or more of the transmembrane proteins, the compound is rescreened using a cell expressing fewer transmembrane proteins, or only one, until the specific interacting transmembrane protein is identified. </p><p> In cells transfected with more than one transmembrane protein, there may be oligomerisation between pairs of proteins as discussed herein, and this may affect the interpretation of the effect of a candidate compound. </p><p>Subsequent rescreening of the compound using cells transfected with only one transmembrane protein allows clarification of the interaction of the compound with a particular protein. </p><p> Alternatively, for multiply transfected cells, transmembrane proteins may be selected which have been shown not to &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;oligomerise&lt;/RTI&gt; with each other. </p><p>Identification of interacting compounds
In one embodiment of the invention, nucleated cells are transfected with a nucleotide sequence encoding a protein comprising a transmembrane protein containing an NLS and a detectable moiety and incubated for a suitable period of time to allow expression of the NLS-transmembrane protein and commencement of its accumulation at the cell membrane. For GPCRs and transporters, for example, a time period of about 6 to 24 hours is suitable. One of skill in the art can readily determine a suitable incubation time for other transmembrane proteins by observation of the accumulation of the protein at the cell membrane. All of the expressed transmembrane protein need not have reached the cell membrane when the candidate compound is added. </p><p>Test cells are then contacted with a candidate compound which is to be tested for interaction with the transmembrane protein for a period of time which is sufficient to allow translocation of a substantial portion of the NLStransmembrane protein, preferably at least 20%, more preferably at least 50%, and still more preferably at least 90%, away from the cell membrane and into or towards the nucleus in a control cell not treated with compound. </p><p>&lt;Desc/Clms Page number 19&gt;</p><p> Depending on the transmembrane protein, this period of time may be from about 6 hours to about 72 hours; a time period of about 24 to about 48 hours is suitable for most transmembrane proteins examined. One of skill in the art can readily determine a suitable time by observation of control cells. </p><p> Test compounds are initially tested generally at a concentration of about 1 to 10 micromolar. </p><p> Test and control cells are then examined to determine the distribution of the detectable moiety and thereby the distribution of the NLS- transmembrane protein. The distribution of the detectable moiety may be determined by various methods. For example, when the detectable moiety is an optically detectable protein, the cells may be examined by direct microscopy and the amount of protein in the nucleus compared between test and control cells. In another embodiment, the amounts of detectable protein or peptide remaining in the membrane of control and test cells are compared. </p><p>In several microscopic fields (5-10), each containing 30-100 cells, the location of the detectable moiety in these cells is determined and counted for each location. The percentage of cells having cell surface, or nuclear labelling and the sum of all the fields is then calculated for the treated and control cells. </p><p> In a further example, when the detectable moiety is an antigenic epitope, the cells are contacted with a detectable antibody system containing an antibody specific for the epitope, as described above. For example, a first antibody specific for the epitope may be used, followed by a fluorescently labelled second antibody specific for the first antibody, the fluorescent signal being quantified by fluorometer. </p><p> Where control cells show a substantial portion, preferably at least 50%, of the transmembrane protein translocated away from the cell membrane and test cells show retention of the transmembrane protein at the cell membrane, relative to control cells, this indicates interaction of the test compound with the transmembrane protein. In a preferred embodiment, interaction is indicated when the level of protein at the cell membrane is higher in the test cells by at least 10%, preferably by at least 15%, and more preferably by at least 20%. </p><p>&lt;Desc/Clms Page number 20&gt;</p><p> The proportion of the detectable moiety remaining at the cell membrane on exposure to the interacting compound is related to the concentration and potency of the compound. For example, the use of a known potent GPCR antagonist in &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;micromolar&lt;/RTI&gt; concentration typically resulted in about 50 to 100% of the protein remaining at the cell surface, 0 to 15% in the nucleus and the remainder in the cytoplasm. Lower &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;nanomolar&lt;/RTI&gt; concentrations of the same antagonist resulted in retention of 20 to 40% of the protein at the cell surface, with the rest of the protein in the cytoplasm and nucleus. In the untreated control cells, 0-15% of the protein was detectable at the cell surface, with the remainder in the cytoplasm and nucleus. </p><p> In a variant of this method, used where the transmembrane protein has known ligands, an expressed NLS-containing transmembrane protein without a detectable moiety is used and distribution of the protein in the cell after treatment with a test compound is determined by isolation of the cell membrane fraction and determination of its transmembrane protein component using detectably labelled ligand, as discussed above. </p><p> In a further embodiment of the invention, a similar method is used to identify compounds which interact with an NLS-transmembrane protein to promote its translocation away from the cell surface and into or towards the nucleus. Cells are transfected and incubated to permit expression of the NLS-transmembrane protein and its accumulation at the cell surface. </p><p>Preferably, the cells are incubated until at least about 70 to 90% of the expressed transmembrane protein has accumulated at the cell surface. For many transmembrane proteins, a time period of about 12 to about 24 hours from transfection is suitable. </p><p> Test cells are then contacted with a candidate compound, and individual test and control cells are immediately observed in real time for up to 4 hours to observe the distribution of the detectable moiety. An increased accumulation of detectable moiety in the nucleus of test cells compared with control cells indicates that the test compound has promoted translocation of the transmembrane protein. In a preferred embodiment, interaction is </p><p>&lt;Desc/Clms Page number 21&gt;</p><p> indicated when test cells show nuclear accumulation increased by at least 5%, preferably by at least 10%, and more preferably by at &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;least 20%.&lt;/RTI&gt; </p><p> A further embodiment of the invention is a method for identifying compounds which, although they do not themselves prevent translocation of an NLS-containing transmembrane protein away from the cell membrane, nevertheless can interfere with the interaction of the transmembrane protein with an interacting compound. </p><p> Compounds which have proved negative in the first screening method described above may be tested by this further method for their ability to compete with a known interacting compound. </p><p> In this method, cells are transfected as described above and incubated for a suitable period of time to allow expression and accumulation of the transmembrane protein at the cell surface, for example for about 24 to about 48 hours. </p><p> Test cells and control cells are then contacted with a compound known to interact with the transmembrane protein, either a known ligand or an interacting compound identified by the method described above, for about 24 to about 48 hours. Test cells are then contacted with a candidate compound and test cells and control cells are observed after 1 hour, at one or more time points, up to 24 hours, to determine distribution of the NLS-transmembrane protein within the cells as described above. In control cells, the known interacting compound causes the transmembrane protein to be retained at the cell membrane. If the candidate compound competes with the interacting compound, test cells show a reduction of transmembrane protein at the cell surface and increased translocation of the protein away from the cell surface. </p><p>In a preferred embodiment, interaction is indicated when test cells show a reduction of at least 10%, preferably 15%, and more preferably 20%. </p><p> In a further embodiment, a cell which &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;endogenously&lt;/RTI&gt; expresses an NLS-containing transmembrane protein may be employed, in conjunction with a first compound which has been demonstrated to interact with the protein and inhibit its transfer from the cell membrane, thus retaining the protein at the cell membrane. When such a system is contacted with a candidate </p><p>&lt;Desc/Clms Page number 22&gt;</p><p> compound, if that compound interacts with the transmembrane protein and competes with the first compound, an increased transfer of the protein away from the cell membrane is observed. </p><p>Identifying transmembrane protein interactions with other proteins
A number of transmembrane proteins, including GPCRs, transporters, tyrosine kinase receptors, the cytokine receptors for insulin, insulin-like growth factors, the epidermal growth factor and vascular endothelial growth factor, are capable of both homo-and heterooligomerisation (see, for example, review of GPCRs in George et &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;al.,&lt;/RTI&gt; 2002). As used herein,"oligomerisation"of a protein means association of two or more molecules of the protein. </p><p> For hypothetical receptors A and B, the cell surface may contain dimers AA, BB and AB and it is believed that these may represent three different functional complexes and therefore three different drug targets. It is therefore important to identify which transmembrane proteins can interact with each other or with other proteins by oligomerisation. </p><p> In further embodiments, the invention provides methods for determining whether two transmembrane proteins are capable of oligomerisation or whether a transmembrane protein and a nontransmembrane protein are capable of oligomerisation. </p><p> In one embodiment, a nucleated cell is co-transfected with a first nucleotide sequence encoding a first transmembrane protein containing an NLS and a second nucleotide sequence encoding a second transmembrane protein lacking an NLS but carrying or linked to a detectable moiety. Creation of these nucleotide sequences is as described above. After a suitable time interval to allow for expression of the encoded proteins, accumulation at the cell membrane and subsequent translocation of the NLS-containing protein away from the cell membrane to or towards the nucleus, the distribution of the detectable moiety in the cell is determined, for example by determining an increase of detectable moiety in the nucleus or by a decrease of detectable moiety at the cell surface. </p><p>&lt;Desc/Clms Page number 23&gt;</p><p> It has been found that when cells are doubly transfected, and the first and second transmembrane protein are the same, except that one transmembrane protein contains an inserted NLS and the other does not, there is a slowing of the transfer of the NLS-containing transmembrane protein to the cell nucleus compared with transfer in a cell transfected only with the NLS-containing protein. The process of protein translocation to the nucleus now may take about 24 to 48 hours. In this method, therefore, the cells are incubated for about 24 to 48 hours before examination of the distribution of protein in the cell. </p><p> Translocation of the detectable moiety from the cell surface to or towards the nucleus indicates that the first transmembrane protein has carried the second transmembrane protein away from the cell surface, indicating oligomerisation of the first and second proteins. Retention of the detectable moiety at the cell surface indicates a lack of interaction between the proteins. </p><p> When the first and second transmembrane proteins are the same protein, the method allows the identification of the ability of the protein to homodimerise. When the first and second transmembrane proteins are different, the method allows the identification of the ability of two different proteins to heterodimerise and permits the determination of the specificity of interaction between two transmembrane proteins. </p><p> The method may be carried out either in the absence of ligand activation or in the presence of a ligand of either protein. </p><p> Using this method, oligomerisation has been demonstrated both within and between different classes of GPCRs and within and between other classes of transmembrane proteins. </p><p> In addition, interactions have been detected between GPCRs and non- GPCR transmembrane proteins, for example between the D5 dopamine receptor and the GABA-A receptor, and between transmembrane proteins and non-transmembrane proteins. </p><p> The invention therefore generally provides a method for detecting oligomerisation between two proteins by the method described above, where </p><p>&lt;Desc/Clms Page number 24&gt;</p><p> a cell is co-transfected with one of the proteins containing an NLS and the other protein carrying a detectable signal. </p><p> Co-transfection of a cell with a first transmembrane protein containing an NLS and a second detectably labelled protein, such as a transmembrane protein from a different group, which has been shown by the method of the invention to oligomerise with the first protein, provides a cell which can be used to screen candidate compounds for interaction with either the first or second protein. A compound which interacts with either protein will influence oligomerisation or translocation of the oligomerised proteins away from the cell membrane. Compounds which interact with one member of the protein pair or with the oligomer to cause retention of the detectable protein at the cell surface or to cause accelerated translocation of the detectable protein away from the cell surface may be identified by this method. </p><p> In a further embodiment, a cell which &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;endogenously&lt;/RTI&gt; expresses an NLS-containing transmembrane protein is transfected with a nucleotide sequence encoding a second transmembrane protein carrying a detectable moiety but lacking an NLS. Oligomerisation of the two proteins is indicated by trafficking of the detectable moiety away from the cell membrane and into or towards the nucleus. </p><p> In a further embodiment, a membrane protein containing an NLS may be used to identify novel interacting proteins. In this method, an NLS- containing transmembrane protein is expressed in a cell and is allowed to translocate to the nucleus. The nuclei are then harvested and assayed for newly appeared protein bands by Coomassie staining or silver staining and then identification by mass spectroscopy. The control will be nuclei from cells expressing the membrane protein without a NLS. </p><p>Use of FRET for detection of nuclear translocation. </p><p> In a further aspect of the invention, involving fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) (Hailey et &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;al.,&lt;/RTI&gt; 2002), a nucleated cell is co- transfected with a first nucleotide sequence encoding a first NLS-containing transmembrane protein linked to a first optically detectable protein and a </p><p>&lt;Desc/Clms Page number 25&gt;</p><p> second nucleotide sequence encoding a second non-NLS-containing transmembrane protein linked to a second optically detectable protein, whose fluorescence can be activated by the emission of the first optically detectable protein when these are in close proximity. For example, the first protein may be linked to GFP and the second any other optically detectable moiety that can be activated by the laser activated emission spectrum of 
GFP. This second optically detectable moiety, after activation by the GFP, emits at a different wavelength. Where oligomers are formed between the two transmembrane proteins, the two labels are in close proximity to each other and their FRET interaction can be detected. The physical interaction is detected by selective fluorescence activation of the donor and detection of emission by the acceptor, using the FRET method or its variants such as photobleaching FRET, FRAP or &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;FLIM.&lt;/RTI&gt; Lack of a FRET interaction indicates lack of oligomerisation. </p><p> Confocal microscopy with FRET between two fluorescent molecules may be performed (e. g. the spectral pairs GFP and DsRed2, or CFP and YFP) to obtain a quantifiable signal indicating translocation to the nucleus. </p><p> FRET requires an overlap between the emission and excitation spectra of donor and acceptor molecules and a proximity of under 100 angstroms (10- 
100), making FRET a highly suitable system to assay for specific close protein-protein interactions in cells. The fluorescent proteins listed above are excellent spectral partners. A resident &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;fluorophore&lt;/RTI&gt; in the nucleus would enable FRET to occur when a transmembrane protein tagged with second &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;fluorophore&lt;/RTI&gt; is translocated to the nucleus. This will facilitate an easy readout, using a FRET plate reader. This method is useful for detecting interactions between two transmembrane proteins or between a transmembrane protein and another protein and provides a signal readout more amenable to automation. </p><p> This method can also be used in GPCR agonist and antagonist screening procedures. In the antagonist screening method, a reduction of a 
FRET signal between a GPCR-NLS-GFP trafficked to the nucleus with a &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;fluorophore&lt;/RTI&gt; in the nucleus of treated cells compared to non treated cells </p><p>&lt;Desc/Clms Page number 26&gt;</p><p> would indicate an antagonist effect. In the agonist screening method, the increase in the FRET signal between a GPCR-NLS-GFP trafficked to the nucleus with a &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;fluorophore&lt;/RTI&gt; in the nucleus of treated cells compared to non treated cells would indicate an agonist effect. In a further embodiment, the doubly transfected cells may be treated with an agonist before examination for evidence of oligomerisation, since this may be enhanced in the presence of agonist. In the measurement of receptor : receptor interactions, a GPCRNLS-GFP is co-expressed with a second GPCR-DsRED. If these receptors interact with each other and traffic together to the nucleus a nuclear FRET signal will be detected. If the receptors do not interact then no FRET signal will be obtained in the nucleus. FRET may also be measured between two fluorophore-conjugated antibodies recognising incorporated ot native epitopes on the GPCRs. </p><p> EXAMPLES

COS cells were transfected with a construct encoding D1-NLS-RFP and with wildtyp D1 (2 micrograms) for 48 hours. At 6,22, 30 and 42 hours after transfection, the cells were treated with the dopamine D1 receptor antagonist SCH23390 (final concentration 10 micromolar). Also at 6,22, 30 and 42 hours after transfection, cells were treated with the antagonist (+) &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;butaclamol&lt;/RTI&gt; (final concentration &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;1or).&lt;/RTI&gt; Control cells received no antagonist treatment. </p><p> At 48 hours, the majority of control cells had detectable D1-NLS-RFP in the nucleus. In contrast, the majority of antagonist-treated cells had fluorescence only on the cell surface, while 42% had fluorescence both on the surface and in the nucleus. </p><p> Example 3: Dopamine D1 receptor &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;(D1-GFP)&lt;/RTI&gt; co-expressed with D1 receptor containing a NLS &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;(D1-NLS)&lt;/RTI&gt; 
HEK cells were transfected with DNA constructs encoding D1-NLS (3 micrograms) and/or D1-GFP (1.5 micrograms), and incubated for 48 hours. </p><p>The cells were also transfected with a plasmid encoding DsRed-NUC to verify the localisation of the nucleus (1 microgram). </p><p> Cells were also transfected with. DNA encoding D1-GFP (2 micrograms), incubated for 48 hours and examined by &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;confocal&lt;/RTI&gt; microscopy. </p><p> D1-GFP expressed alone revealed that 90% of the cells demonstrated cell surface labelling and 10% showed both nuclear and cell surface labelling. With any DNA encoding a GPCR transfection, up to 10% of cells may be observed with a nuclear localisation. </p><p>&lt;Desc/Clms Page number 55&gt;</p><p> Cells expressing D1-GFP and D1-NLS showed 35% of cells with both nuclear and cell surface labelling and 70% with receptor expression on cell surface only. This experiment indicated that D1-GFP co-trafficked with &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;D1-&lt;/RTI&gt; 
NLS resulting from oligomerisation of the D1-NLS and &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;D1-GFP.&lt;/RTI&gt; </p><p> Example 4: Dopamine D1 receptor containing a NLS &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;(D1-NLS-GFP),&lt;/RTI&gt; was treated with an antagonist in a dose response study 
HEK cells were transfected with DNA encoding D1-NLS-GFP (2 micrograms), and &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;D1-WT&lt;/RTI&gt; (6 micrograms) for &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;48&lt;/RTI&gt; hours. These cells were treated 6 hrs after transfection with SCH-23390 (10 micromolar), or (+) butaclamol (10 micromolar). The medium containing antagonist was changed at 6,22, 30 and 42 hours after transfection. Control cells received no antagonist treatment. </p><p> Following SCH-23390 treatment for 48 hours, 58% of the cells had cell surface expression of &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;D1-NLS-GFP,&lt;/RTI&gt; less than 10% of the cells had receptor expression in the nucleus and 32% of the cells had receptor expression on both the cell surface and in the nucleus. </p><p> Following (+) butaclamol treatment for 48 hours, 62% of the cells had cell surface expression of the D1-NLS-GFP receptor, &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;10%&lt;/RTI&gt; had receptor expression in the nucleus, and 28% of the cells had receptor expression on the cell surface and in the nucleus. </p><p> Control cells at 48 hours showed approximately 65% with D1-NLS- 
GFP receptor expression in the nucleus, and 35% with receptor expression in the cytoplasm. No receptor D1-NLS-GFP expression was found on the cell surface of control cells. </p><p> Incorporation of an NLS into the receptor sequence caused a very efficient removal of the D1-NLS-GFP receptor from the cell surface and localisation in the nucleus. </p><p> Similar studies were carried out at various doses of SCH-23390 or (+) &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;butaclamol. Results&lt;/RTI&gt; are shown in Tables 2 and 3.32% to 35% of control cells showed receptor in cytoplasm. </p><p>&lt;Desc/Clms Page number 56&gt;</p><p>Table 2

Incorporation of an NLS into the receptor sequence caused a very efficient removal of the D1 dopamine receptor from the cell surface and localisation in the nucleus. Treatment with D1 selective antagonists prevented this receptor translocation in a dose-responsive manner. </p><p> Example 4a: Expression of the dopamine D1 receptor with an inserted NLS (D1-NLS-GFP) and treatment with agonists 
HEK cells were transfected with a DNA construct encoding D1-NLS- GFP (1.5 micrograms), and incubated with the &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;D1&lt;/RTI&gt; agonist SKF-81297 (10 </p><p>&lt;Desc/Clms Page number 57&gt;</p><p> micromolar) for 48 hours. At 6,22, 30 and 42 hours after transfection, the cells were treated with fresh medium containing SKF-81297 (final concentration 10 micromolar). The cells were examined by &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;confocal&lt;/RTI&gt; microscopy. </p><p> HEK cells were transfected with a DNA construct encoding D1-NLS- GFP (1.5 micrograms of DNA), and incubated with the agonist pergolide (10 micromolar) for 48 hours. At 6,22, 30 and 42 hours after transfection, the cells were treated with fresh medium containing &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;SKF-81297&lt;/RTI&gt; (final concentration 10 micromolar). The cells were examined by &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;confocal&lt;/RTI&gt; microscopy. </p><p> Control HEK cells were transfected with a DNA construct encoding &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;D1-&lt;/RTI&gt; NLS-GFP (1.5 micrograms of DNA) and left untreated. </p><p> In the untreated cells after 48 hrs, there was no receptor detected at the cell surface. With cells treated with SKF-81297,59% of cells had receptor expression at the cell surface. With cells treated with perglolide there was receptor surface expression in 59% of the cells. Thus long-term treatment with agonists prevented the modified D1 receptor from trafficking to the nucleus. </p><p> Example 5: Dopamine D1 receptor with an incorporated NLS &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;(D1-&lt;/RTI&gt; NLS-RFP) co-expressed with the wild type D1 receptor
COS cells were co-transfected with a DNA construct encoding &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;D1-&lt;/RTI&gt; NLS-RFP (1 microgram) and a DNA sequence encoding the native dopamine D1 receptor &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;(D1-WT,&lt;/RTI&gt; 7 microgram) and incubated for 24 or 48 hours. </p><p> At 24 hours, &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;D1-NLS-RFP&lt;/RTI&gt; was detected only at the cell surface, whereas at 48 hours, 80% of cells had D1-NLS-RFP in the nucleus. The wild type receptor retarded the movement of the D1-NLS-RFP to the nucleus by homo-oligomerisation. </p><p> Example 6: D1 dopamine receptor with an incorporated NLS &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;(D1-&lt;/RTI&gt; NLS-RFP) co-expressed with D1-GFP
COS cells were transfected with a construct encoding D1-NLS-RFP (4 micrograms) and the dopamine D1-GFP (4 micrograms), and incubated for 48 hours. The cells were examined by &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;confocal&lt;/RTI&gt; microscopy. </p><p>&lt;Desc/Clms Page number 58&gt;</p><p> D1-GFP was detected at the cell surface and a yellow fluoresence was detected in the nuclei, the latter indicating co-localisation of both &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;D1-&lt;/RTI&gt; NLS-RFP and D1-GFP in the nucleus, confirming oligomerisation of &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;D1-&lt;/RTI&gt; NLS-RFP and &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;D1-GFP,&lt;/RTI&gt; leading to importation of D1-GFP into the nucleus. </p><p> Example 6a: Expression of the D1 dopamine receptor with an NLS inserted in the third intracellular cytoplasmic loop (D1-IC3-NLS-GFP) 
HEK cells were transfected with a DNA construct encoding D1-IC3-NLS- GFP (2 micrograms), and incubated for 48 hours. Nuclei were visualised with &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;DsRED-NUC&lt;/RTI&gt; (2 micrograms). The cells were examined by &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;confocal&lt;/RTI&gt; microscopy. </p><p> In cells transfected with D1-IC3-NLS-GFP, the receptor was detected in the nucleus of 85% of cells. Thus insertion of a NLS into the third intracellular loop enabled receptor trafficking to the nucleus. </p><p> Example 6b: Expression of the D1 dopamine receptor with an NLS inserted in the first intracellular cytoplasmic loop (D1-lC1-NLS-GFP) 
HEK cells were transfected with a DNA construct encoding D1-IC1- NLS-GFP (2 micrograms), and incubated for 48 hours. Nuclei were visualised with &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;DsRED-NUC&lt;/RTI&gt; (2 micrograms). The cells were examined by &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;confocal&lt;/RTI&gt; microscopy. </p><p> In cells transfected with D1-IC1-NLS-GFP, the receptor was detected in the nucleus of 85% of cells. Thus insertion of a NLS into the first intracellular loop enabled receptor trafficking to the nucleus. </p><p> Example 6c: Effect of the antagonist &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;butaclamol&lt;/RTI&gt; or SCH-23390 on the trafficking of the D1 dopamine receptor with an NLS inserted in the first cytoplasmic loop &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;(D1-IC1-NLS-GFP)&lt;/RTI&gt; 
HEK cells were transfected with a DNA construct encoding D1-IC1-NLS- GFP (2 micrograms), and treated with either butaclamol (final concentration 1 &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;micromolar&lt;/RTI&gt; or SCH-23390 (1 &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;micromolar),&lt;/RTI&gt; for 48 hours. Nuclei were visualised with &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;DsRED-NUC&lt;/RTI&gt; (2 micrograms). The cells were examined by &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;confocal&lt;/RTI&gt; microscopy. </p><p>&lt;Desc/Clms Page number 59&gt;</p><p> With the &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;butaclamol&lt;/RTI&gt; treated cells, 82% had receptor on the cell surface or in the cytoplasm. 18% of the cells had receptor in the nucleus. Thus treatment with butaclamol reduced D1-lC1-NLS-GFP trafficking to the nucleus. </p><p> With the SCH-23390 treated cells, 77% of the cells had receptor on the cells surface or in the cytoplasm. 23% of the cells had receptor in the nucleus. </p><p> Thus treatment with SCH-23390 reduced receptor trafficking to the nucleus. </p><p> With the untreated cells 76% had receptor expression in the nucleus and cytoplasm. </p><p> Example 6d: Effect of the antagonist SCH-23390 on the trafficking of the D1 dopamine receptor with an NLS inserted in the third cytoplasmic loop &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt; (D1-IC3-NLS-GFP)&lt;/RTI&gt; 
HEK cells were transfected with a DNA construct encoding D1-IC3-NLS- 
GFP (2 micrograms), and treated with four different concentrations of SCH-23390 (10 micromolar, 1 micromolar, 500 nanomolar and 100 &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;nanomolar),&lt;/RTI&gt; for 48 hours. </p><p> Nuclei were visualised with &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;DsRED-NUC&lt;/RTI&gt; (2 micrograms). The cells were examined by &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;confocal&lt;/RTI&gt; microscopy. </p><p> 86% of the cells transfected with D1-IC3-NLS-GFP had the receptor in the nucleus, and 0% had receptor on the surface. With the SCH-23390 treated cells, 
84% had receptor in the nucleus and 15% of the cells had receptor on the surface. The insertion of an NLS at this position in the GPCR will translocate the receptor to the nucleus efficiently but does not respond to the drug. </p><p> Example 6e: Expression of the D1 dopamine receptor with an NLS inserted in the second intracellular cytoplasmic loop (D1-IC2-NLS-GFP) 
HEK cells were transfected with a DNA construct encoding D1-IC2-NLS- 
GFP (2 micrograms), and incubated for 48 hours. Nuclei were visualised with &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;DsRED-NUC&lt;/RTI&gt; (2 micrograms). The cells were examined by &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;confocal&lt;/RTI&gt; microscopy. </p><p> In cells transfected with &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;D1-lC2-NLS-GFP,&lt;/RTI&gt; the receptor was detected in the nucleus of 51 % of cells. </p><p> Example 6f: Ability of the dopamine &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;D1&lt;/RTI&gt; receptor to homodimerise, with staggered transfection 
HEK cells were transfected with a DNA construct encoding D1-RFP (2 micrograms) and after 24 hours incubation, the cells were transfected with a </p><p>&lt;Desc/Clms Page number 60&gt;</p><p> second DNA construct encoding D1-NLS-GFP (2 micrograms). Control cells were transfected with the D1-RFP (2 micrograms) construct alone. The cells were incubated for 48 hours following the second transfection and examined by &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;confocal&lt;/RTI&gt; microscopy. </p><p> 90% of the cells transfected with D1-RFP alone expressed receptor on the cell surface, and 6% of the cells expressed receptor in the nucleus. In contrast, 97% of the cells expressing both forms of the receptor expressed both receptors (red plus green equals yellow fluorescence) in the nucleus. Thus, the D1 receptor without the NLS interacted with the D1 receptor with the NLS in order to traffic to the nucleus. </p><p> Example 7: Dopamine D5 receptor (D5-GFP) 
A construct encoding the dopamine D5 receptor-GFP (D5-GFP) was prepared and used to transfect COS cells (4 micrograms). </p><p> Cells transfected with dopamine D5-GFP, at 48 hours, showed mainly a cytoplasmic localisation of receptor, with cell surface localisation in only a few cells and no instances of nuclear localisation. </p><p> Example 8: Dopamine D1 with an incorporated NLS &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;(D1-NLS)&lt;/RTI&gt; co- expressed with the D5 dopamine receptor (D5-GFP) 
HEK cells were transfected with two DNA constructs, one encoding D1-NLS (7 micrograms) and the other encoding D5-GFP (1.5 micrograms), and incubated for 48 hours. </p><p> Approximately 70% of the cells transfected with D1-NLS and D5-GFP had cell surface expression of D5-GFP, 20% of the cells had both surface and cytoplasm expression of D5-GFP, and 10% had nuclear expression of D5-GFP. There was no nuclear translocation of the D5 dopamine receptor coexpressed with &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;D1-NLS,&lt;/RTI&gt; indicating that the D1 and D5 receptors did not oligomerise. </p><p> Example 9: D1 dopamine receptor containing two NLS motifs &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;(D1-&lt;/RTI&gt; 2NLS-RFP) and treated with antagonist 
By modifying the construct encoding &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;D1-NLS-RFP,&lt;/RTI&gt; a DNA construct &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;(D1-2NLS-RFP)&lt;/RTI&gt; was created to introduce a second NLS into the carboxyl tail </p><p>&lt;Desc/Clms Page number 61&gt;</p><p> of the dopamine D1 receptor by replacing the KKEEA sequence of the wild type D1 dopamine receptor with the NLS, KKKRK. </p><p> HEK cells were transfected with DNA encoding this construct &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;(D1-&lt;/RTI&gt; 2NLS-RFP), and treated at intervals with the antagonist SCH-23390 &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;(10) 1M)&lt;/RTI&gt; as previously described. At 6,22, 30 and 42 hours after transfection, the culture medium containing antagonist was replaced. Control cells received no antagonist. </p><p> In both COS and HEK cells transfected with D1-2NLS-RFP, the receptor was located in the nucleus in 100% of cells after 24 hours, indicating enhanced nuclear translocation when a second NLS was present. </p><p> At 48 hours, 90% of cells not treated with antagonist showed fluorescence in the nucleus and 0% of cells had fluorescence on the cell surface. Antagonist-treated cells showed &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;51%&lt;/RTI&gt; of cells with cell surface label and 49% with nuclear label. </p><p> Incorporation of a second NLS resulted in a more efficient transport of the receptor to the nucleus, and this event was still retarded by antagonist treatment. </p><p> Example 10: D2 dopamine receptor (D2-GFP) 
HEK cells were transfected with DNA constructs encoding D2-GFP (2 micrograms) and DsRed-NUC (1 microgram), and incubated for 48 hours. </p><p>Cells were examined by &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;confocal&lt;/RTI&gt; microscopy. </p><p> Approximately 90% of the cells expressing D2-GFP had cell surface expression, and 10% had &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;nuclear or cytoplasm&lt;/RTI&gt; expression. The D2 dopamine receptor, having no endogenous NLS, is predominantly expressed on the cell surface. </p><p> Example 11 a : Dopamine D1 receptor with an incorporated NLS &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;(D1-&lt;/RTI&gt; NLS) and dopamine D2 (D2-GFP) 
HEK cells were transfected with DNA constructs encoding D1-NLS (7 micrograms), and D2-GFP (1.5 micrograms) and incubated for &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;48&lt;/RTI&gt; hours. </p><p>The cells were also transfected with Ds-Red-NUC to verify the localisation of the nucleus (1 microgram). The cells were examined by &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;confocal&lt;/RTI&gt; microscopy. </p><p>&lt;Desc/Clms Page number 62&gt;</p><p> In cells transfected with D1-NLS and D2-GFP, 33% of the cells had D2-GFP expression in the nucleus, indicating transport of both D1-NLS and D2-GFP to the nucleus, due to oligomerisation between the D1 and D2 receptors. 67% of the cells had D2-GFP receptors on the cell surface only or on surface and cytoplasm. </p><p> Example &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;11 b&lt;/RTI&gt; : Ability of D2 dopamine receptor D2 short (D2S) to dimerise with dopamine receptor D2 long (D2L) 
HEK cells were transfected with DNA constructs encoding D2S-GFP (2 micrograms) and D2L-NLS (2 micrograms) and were incubated for 48 hours. </p><p>Nuclei were visualised with DsRED-NUC (2 micrograms). The cells were examined by &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;confocal&lt;/RTI&gt; microscopy. </p><p> D2S-GFP receptor was visualised in the nuclei of 29% of cells. This indicated that D2S dimerised with D2L and was transported to the nucleus. </p><p> Example 11c : Ability of dopamine receptor D2S to dimerise with dopamine receptor D2L. </p><p> HEK cells were transfected with DNA constructs encoding D2S-RFP (2 micrograms) and D2L-NLS-GFP (2 micrograms) and incubated for 48 hours. The cells were examined by &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;confocal&lt;/RTI&gt; microscopy. </p><p> 40% of the cells had a yellow colour (red plus green overlay) in the nucleus, indicating that D2L-NLS dimerised with D2S-RFP and transported it to the nucleus. </p><p> Example 12: D2 dopamine receptor with an incorporated NLS (D2- NLS-GFP) treated with antagonists
HEK cells were transfected with DNA encoding D2-NLS-GFP and the cells were treated with the D2 dopamine receptor antagonists, (+) butaclamol (10 &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;micromolar)&lt;/RTI&gt; or raclopride (10 micromolar). At 6,22, 30 and 42 hours after transfection, the cells were treated with the antagonists. Cells were incubated 48 hrs after drug treatment and examined by &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;confocal&lt;/RTI&gt; microscopy. </p><p> In the absence of antagonist, cells expressing D2-NLS-GFP showed nuclear label in 70% of cells, and cytoplasmic labelling in 20% and cytoplasmic and surface labelling in 10% of cells. With (+) &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;butaclamol&lt;/RTI&gt; treatment, nuclear labelling appeared in only 5% of cells, 5% of cells had </p><p>&lt;Desc/Clms Page number 63&gt;</p><p> cytoplasmic label and 90% of the cells had cell surface labelling. With raclopride treatment, 5% of cells showed nuclear labelling, 15% of cells had cytoplasmic labelling and 80% of cells had cell surface labelling. Both antagonists of the D2 receptor prevented the translocation of the receptor off the cell surface and to the nucleus. </p><p> Example 13: Beta2-adrenergic receptor-GFP (beta2-AR-GFP) 
A DNA construct was created encoding a fusion protein comprising the human beta2-adrenergic receptor and GFP (beta2-AR-GFP). Cells were transfected with the DNA construct encoding beta2-AR-GFP (2 micrograms), and incubated for 24 hours and examined by &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;confocal&lt;/RTI&gt; microscopy. </p><p> In cells expressing beta2-AR-GFP, 42% of cells had receptor expression in cytoplasm only, and 58% of the cells had receptor expression in the cytoplasm and on the cell surface. No nuclear localisation of the receptor was observed. </p><p> Example 14: Beta2-adrenergic receptor with an incorporated NLS (beta2-AR-NLS3-GFP) 
A DNA construct was created encoding a fusion protein comprising the human beta2-AR-NLS3-GFP. HEK cells were transfected with DNA encoding beta2-AR-NLS3-GFP-3 (2 microgram), and Ds-Red-NUC (1 microgram) and the cells were incubated for 48 hours. </p><p> 45% of the cells transfected with beta2-AR-NLS3-GFP had nuclear localisation of receptor and 55% of the cells had surface and cytoplasmic expression. Incorporation of a NLS into the beta2-AR induced receptor translocation to the nucleus. </p><p> Example 15: Beta2-adrenergic receptor with an incorporated NLS (beta2-AR-NLS3-GFP), treated with antagonist
HEK cells were transfected with DNA encoding beta2-AR-NLS3-GFP- 3 (1 microgram), and Ds-Red-NUC (1 microgram) and incubated for 48 hours. Cells were treated at intervals with atenolol (10 micromolar), an adrenergic receptor antagonist. At 6,22, 30 and 42 hours after transfection, the culture medium containing the antagonist was replaced. </p><p>&lt;Desc/Clms Page number 64&gt;</p><p> Control cells received no antagonist. In control cells, 60% had receptor expression in the nucleus, 21 % had receptor expression on the cell surface, 19% had receptor expression in the cytoplasm. </p><p> In antagonist atenolol-treated cells, 70% had receptor expression on the cell surface, &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;14%&lt;/RTI&gt; had receptor expression in the nucleus, and 16% had receptor expression in the cytoplasm. Treatment with the antagonist atenolol prevented beta2-AR-NLS3-GFP trafficking to the nucleus and retained the receptor on the cell surface. </p><p> Example 16: Beta2-adrenergic receptor (beta2-AR-GFP) coexpressed with dopamine D1 receptor with an incorporated NLS &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;(D1-NLS)&lt;/RTI&gt; 
HEK cells were transfected with DNA constructs encoding the beta2- AR-GFP (1.5 microgram) and D1-NLS (3 microgram) for 48 hours. </p><p> Approximately 40% of cells showed beta2-AR-GFP receptor expression in the nucleus, demonstrating that the beta2-AR not containing an NLS had trafficked to the nucleus. This indicated that oligomerisation had occurred between the beta2-AR receptor and D1 dopamine receptor, containing the NLS. 45% of the cells showed beta2-AR-GFP in the cytoplasm and 15% in cytoplasm and on cell surface. </p><p> Example 17: Beta2-adrenergic receptor (beta2-AR-GFP) and dopamine D1 receptor with an incorporated NLS &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;(D1-NLS)&lt;/RTI&gt; treated with antagonist 
HEK cells were transfected with DNA constructs encoding beta2-AR- GFP (1.5 micrograms) and D1-NLS (3 micrograms) and incubated for 48 hours. These cells were treated with the adrenergic antagonist, propranolol (5 micromolar). At 6,22, 30 and 42 hours after transfection the culture medium containing the antagonist was replaced. Control cells received no antagonist. The cells were examined by confocal microscopy. </p><p> 25% of control cells showed beta2-AR-GFP nuclear expression and 75% of cells showed label in cytoplasm and on cell surface. </p><p> In &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;propranolol-treated cells,&lt;/RTI&gt; beta2-AR-GFP nuclear expression was 10%, and 90% of the cells showed cytoplasmic and surface label. The formation of a heterooligomer with between beta2-AR-GFP and D1-NLS </p><p>&lt;Desc/Clms Page number 65&gt;</p><p> resulted in the trafficking of the beta2-AR-GFP to the nucleus. This trafficking was attenuated by the presence of the antagonist to the adrenergic receptor. </p><p> Example 18: Beta2-adrenergic receptor with an incorporated NLS (beta2-AR-NLS3-GFP) 
HEK cells were transfected with a DNA construct containing an NLS encoding &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;beta2-AR-NLS3-GFP&lt;/RTI&gt; (8 micrograms) for 48 hours. The cells were also transfected Ds-Red-NUC to verify the localisation of the nucleus (1 microgram). </p><p> 80% of cells showed beta2-AR-NLS3-GFP receptor in the nucleus. </p><p>The efficiency of the NLS was improved, resulting in a greater localisation of receptor in the nucleus. </p><p> Example 19: Serotonin 1 B receptor with an incorporated NLS (5HT1 B-NLS-GFP) and treatment with antagonist 
HEK cells were transfected with a DNA construct encoding the serotonin 5HT1 B-NLS-GFP (2 micrograms). The cells were transfected with Ds-red-NUC to verify the localisation of the nucleus (1 microgram). Cells were treated with methysergide (10 micromolar), a serotonin receptor antagonist. At 6,22, 30 and 42 hours after transfection, the culture medium containing antagonist was replaced. Control cells received no antagonist. </p><p>The cells were examined by &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;confocal&lt;/RTI&gt; microscopy. </p><p> Control cells, not treated with antagonist, showed 55% with receptor localised in the nucleus, and 20% with receptor localised on the cell surface. </p><p>At 48 hours, methysergide-treated cells showed 25% of the cells had receptor in the nucleus and 62% of the cells had cell surface localisation. </p><p> The serotonin &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;5HT1 B&lt;/RTI&gt; receptor was efficiently translocated from the cell surface to the nucleus by insertion of the NLS. Treatment with the serotonin antagonist methysergide prevented the translocation of the receptor. </p><p> Example 20: Cysteinyl leukotriene receptor-2 with an incorporated NLS (CysLT2-NLS-GFP) </p><p>&lt;Desc/Clms Page number 66&gt;</p><p> 
HEK cells were transfected for 48 hours with a DNA construct encoding CysLT2-NLS-GFP (8 micrograms). The cells were also transfected with &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;Ds-RED-NUC&lt;/RTI&gt; to verify the localisation of the nucleus &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;(1&lt;/RTI&gt; microgram). The cells were examined by confocal microscopy. </p><p> 83% of cells expressing Cys-LT2-NLS-GFP showed receptor expression in the nucleus and 0% of cells had receptor expression on the cell surface, indicating Cys-LT2-NLS-GFP receptor localisation in the nucleus. </p><p> Example &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;21&lt;/RTI&gt; : Cysteinyl leukotriene receptor-2 with an incorporated NLS (Cys-LT2-NLS-GFP) treated with antagonist 
The DNA encoding Cys-LT2-NLS-GFP (3 micrograms) was used to transfect HEK cells. These cells were treated with the cysteinyl leukotriene receptor antagonist, montelukast (10 micromolar). At 6,22, 30 and 42 hours after transfection the culture medium containing antagonist was replaced. </p><p>Control cells received no antagonist. The cells were examined by &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;confocal&lt;/RTI&gt; microscopy. </p><p> In the absence of antagonist, 70% of cells expressing Cys-LT2-NLS- GFP had localisation of receptor in the nucleus and 30% of cells showed a cytoplasmic localisation with 0% of cells showing receptor on the cell surface. For the antagonist-treated cells, only 10% showed nuclear localisation of the receptor, while 90% showed cell surface expression of receptor. Thus the cysteinyl leukotriene receptor antagonist montelukast prevented the transport of the Cys-LT2-NLS-GFP receptor off the cell surface and into the nucleus. </p><p> Example 22: Mu opioid receptor with an incorporated NLS (mu opioid-NLS-GFP) 
HEK cells were transfected for &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;48&lt;/RTI&gt; hours with a DNA construct encoding the mu opioid-NLS-GFP (2 micrograms). The cells were also transfected with Ds-Red-NUC (1 microgram) to verify the localisation of the nucleus. The cells were examined by &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;confocal&lt;/RTI&gt; microscopy. </p><p> 65% of the mu opioid-NLS-GFP transfected cells showed receptor expression in the nucleus. 15% of the cells showed cell surface localisation </p><p>&lt;Desc/Clms Page number 67&gt;</p><p> of receptor and 20% receptor of cells had cytoplasmic labelling. Thus the insertion of the NLS permitted the mu opioid receptor to traffic to the nucleus. </p><p> Example 23: Mu opioid receptor with an incorporated NLS (mu-NLS- GFP) treated with antagonists 
HEK cells were transfected with a DNA construct encoding the mu opioid-NLS-GFP (2 micrograms). The transfected cells were treated with the mu opioid antagonists, naloxone (10 &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;micromolar)&lt;/RTI&gt; or &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;naltrexone&lt;/RTI&gt; (10 micromolar). At 6,22, 30 and 42 hours after transfection the culture medium containing the antagonist was replaced. Control cells received no antagonist. The cells were examined by confocal microscopy. </p><p> When untreated, 62% of cells had Mu-NLS-GFP in the nucleus and 20% of cells had receptor detectable on the cell surface. With naloxone treatment, &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;21 % of cells&lt;/RTI&gt; had receptor expression in the nucleus and 66% of cells had receptor on the cell surface. With naltrexone treatment, 22% of cells had receptor expression in the nucleus and 58% of cells had receptor on the cell surface. Thus the mu opioid antagonists naloxone and naltrexone reduced receptor translocation off the cell surface and to the nucleus. </p><p> Example 24: Muscarinic M1 receptorwith an incorporated NLS &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;(M1-&lt;/RTI&gt; NLS-GFP) treated with antagonist 
HEK cells were transfected with DNA encoding M1-NLS-GFP &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;(1&lt;/RTI&gt; microgram), and Ds-Red-NUC &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;(1&lt;/RTI&gt; microgram) for 48 hours. These cells were treated with iprotropium bromide (10 micromolar). The medium containing antagonist was replaced at 6,22, 30 and 42 hours after transfection. Control cells received no antagonist treatment. The cells were examined by &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;confocal&lt;/RTI&gt; microscopy. </p><p> Following iprotropium bromide treatment, 72% of the cells had receptor expression on the cell surface, 17% had receptor expression in the &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;cytoplasm only, 11 %&lt;/RTI&gt; of the cells had receptor expression in the nucleus. </p><p>&lt;Desc/Clms Page number 68&gt;</p><p> For control cells, 64% had receptor expression in the nucleus, 23% had receptor expression on the cell surface and 13% of the cells had receptor expression in cytoplasm. </p><p> Treatment with a muscarinic antagonist prevented the M1-NLS-GFP from translocating off the cell surface and trafficking to the nucleus. </p><p> Example 25: Histamine &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;H1&lt;/RTI&gt; receptor with an incorporated NLS &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;(H1-&lt;/RTI&gt; NLS-GFP) 
HEK cells were transfected with a DNA construct encoding the histamine H1-NLS-GFP receptor (2 micrograms), and a construct encoding Ds-Red-NUC (1 microgram) for and incubated for 48 hours. </p><p> Approximately 65% of the cells had receptor expression in the nucleus, and 35% of the cells had receptor expression on both surface and cytoplasm-. Insertion of the NLS into the H1 histamine receptor resulted in translocation of the receptor off the surface and to the nucleus. </p><p> Example 26: Effect of the antagonist promethazine on the trafficking of the H1 histamine receptor with an NLS inserted (H1-NLS-GFP) 
HEK cells were transfected with H1-NLS-GFP (2 micrograms) and &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;DsRED-Nuc&lt;/RTI&gt; (2 micrograms) and incubated for 48 hours. The cells were treated with promethazine (10 &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;micromolar)&lt;/RTI&gt; for 48 hours. Nucleii were visualised with &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;DsRED-Nuc.&lt;/RTI&gt; The cells were examined by &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;confocal&lt;/RTI&gt; microscopy. </p><p> With the promethazine treated cells 88% of the cells had receptor on the cell surface, 10% of the cells had receptor in the nucleus. With the untreated cells 85% had receptor expression in the nucleus and cytoplasm. </p><p>Thus treatment with promethazine reduced H1-NLS-GFP trafficking to the nucleus. </p><p> Example 26: Angiotensin AT1 receptor &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;(AT1 R)&lt;/RTI&gt; 
A DNA construct &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;(AT1 R-RFP)&lt;/RTI&gt; was created encoding a fusion protein comprising the NLS-containing human angiotensin &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;AT1&lt;/RTI&gt; receptor and DsRed2 (RFP). </p><p> COS cells were transfected with the DNA construct AT1 R-RFP (4 micrograms) and incubated for 48 hours at &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;37 C.&lt;/RTI&gt; </p><p>&lt;Desc/Clms Page number 69&gt;</p><p> Cells were examined by confocal microscopy and the receptor was found to be located exclusively within the nuclei of the cells, indicating a basal agonist-independent translocation of the AT1 R into the nucleus. </p><p> Example 27 : Dopamine receptor (D1-NLS-GFP) treated with agonist for a short term 
HEK cells were transfected with the DNA constructs encoding &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;D1-&lt;/RTI&gt; NLS-GFP (2 micrograms), and &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;D1-WT&lt;/RTI&gt; (4 micrograms), and the cells incubated for 24 hours. The cells were treated with the dopamine D1 agonist, SKF 81297 (10 &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;micromolar)&lt;/RTI&gt; &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;for 35&lt;/RTI&gt; mins. A single group of cells were visualised by &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;confocal&lt;/RTI&gt; microscopy in real time. </p><p> An increased expression of the receptor in the nucleus was demonstrated, with a maximum increase occurring at 20 minutes, indicating short term agonist effect. </p><p> Example 28: Dopamine transporter with a NLS, fused to GFP and RFP (DAT-NLS-GFP and DAT-NLS-RFP) 
HEK cells were transfected with a DNA construct encoding DAT-GFP (2 micrograms) for 48 hours. Nuclei were visualised with DsRED-nuc (2 micrograms) using &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;confocal&lt;/RTI&gt; microscopy. </p><p> At 48 hours, DAT-GFP was detected on the cell surface or in the cytoplasm in 86% of the cells.

HEK cells were transfected with DNA constructs encoding DAT-NLS-RFP (2 micrograms) and DAT-GFP (2 micrograms), and incubated for 48 hours. The cells were examined by confocal microscopy. </p><p> A yellow fluorescence was detected in the nuclei in 56% of the cells, indicating co-localisation of DAT-NLS-RFP and DAT-GFP in the nucleus, confirming oligomerisation of DAT-NLS-RFP and DAT-GFP. </p><p> Example 30: Effect of cocaine on DAT-NLS-RFP trafficking to the nucleus 
HEK cells were transfected with a DNA construct encoding DAT-NLS-RFP (2 micrograms) and incubated for 48 hours. At 6,22, 30 and 42 hours after transfection, the cells were treated with cocaine or amphetamine (final concentration 10 micromolar), or left untreated. The cells were examined by confocal microscopy. </p><p> In the non-treated HEK cells, 77% of the cells had DAT-NLS-RFP expression in the nucleus. </p><p> Following cocaine treatment, 75% of the cells had cell surface or cytoplasmic expression of DAT-NLS-RFP, whereas 25% of the cells had transporter expression in the nucleus and cytoplasm. Treatment with cocaine reduced the trafficking of the DAT-NLS-RFP to the nucleus. </p><p> Following amphetamine treatment, 34% of the cells had cell surface/cytoplasm expression, and 66% of the cells had transporter expression in the nucleus/cytoplasm. Treatment with an amphetamine (which does not target DAT but targets the &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;vesicular monoamine&lt;/RTI&gt; transporter, VMAT) had no inhibitory effect on the trafficking of the DAT-NLS-RFP to the nucleus. </p><p> Example 31: Expression of the dopamine transporter with a NLS (DAT- NLS-GFP) and treatment with antagonists 
HEK cells were transfected with a DNA construct encoding DAT-NLS-GFP (2 micrograms) and incubated for 48 hours.

Treatment with mazindol reduced the DAT-NLS-GFP translocation of the cell surface and trafficking to the nucleus. </p><p> Example 32: Ability of dopamine transporter to homooligomerise, using staggered expression of DAT-GFP and DAT-NLS-RFP 
HEK cells were transfected with the DNA construct encoding DAT-GFP (2 micrograms) and 24 hrs later with the DNA construct encoding DAT-NLS-RFP (0.5, 1, and 2 micrograms) and incubated for 48 hours.

In the staggered experiment (ratio 1: 1), 94% of the cells had yellow fluorescence in the nucleus. In the staggered experiment (ratio 1: 2), 94% of the cells had yellow fluorescence in the nucleus. Therefore the DAT-GFP interacted with and dimerised with DAT-NLS-RFP in order to traffic to the nucleus. </p><p> Example 33: Expression of the metabotropic glutamate-4-receptor &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;(mGluR4-GFP)&lt;/RTI&gt; </p><p>&lt;Desc/Clms Page number 72&gt;</p><p>

Following this, the cells were fixed with &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;paraformaldehyde,&lt;/RTI&gt; and cell surface receptors were detected with a rat anti-HA antibody and then a goat anti- rat antibody conjugated to &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;FITC.&lt;/RTI&gt; The fluorescent signal was detected by &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;fluorometry&lt;/RTI&gt; (Cytofluor). The results are the average of five wells per experimental condition. There was a dose-dependent effect of SCH 23390 to retain receptor on the cell surface, indicating that this antagonist reduced receptor trafficking from the cell surface. The concomitant addition of agonist reduced the antagonist effect (Figure 3). Thus agonist action can be detected by blockade of antagonist effect and fluorometry can be utilised to quantify the agonist effect. </p><p> Example 43b: Expression of the dopamine D1 receptor with an inserted NLS &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;(HA-D1-NLS),&lt;/RTI&gt; and blockade of antagonist effect by agonist dose-response and detection with fluorometry. </p><p> HEK cells were transfected with &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;HA-D1-NLS&lt;/RTI&gt; in a multi-well plate were coated with poly-L-ornithine at a concentration of 50,000 cells per well. The cells were treated with the antagonist SCH 23390 (0.5 micromolar) for &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;48&lt;/RTI&gt; hrs. The agonist SKF 81297 (100 nanomolar to 1 micromolar) together with SCH 23390 was added for the last hour of incubation. Following this, the cells were fixed with &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;paraformaldehyde,&lt;/RTI&gt; and cell surface receptors were detected with a rat anti-HA antibody and then a goat anti-rat antibody conjugated to &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;FITC.&lt;/RTI&gt; The fluorescent signal was detected by fluorometry &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;(Cytofluor).&lt;/RTI&gt; The results are the average of five wells per experimental condition. </p><p>&lt;Desc/Clms Page number 76&gt;</p><p> Treatment with SCH 23390 retained HA-D1-NLS on the cell surface (Figure 4, Bar 1 vs. Bar 6). Short-term addition of the agonist resulted in a dose- dependent blockade of SCH 23390 effect. Removal of SCH 23390 from the cells for the last hour of incubation (and in the absence of agonist) resulted in a 33% loss of HA-D1-NLS receptors from the cell surface (Figure 4, Bar 5 vs. Bar 6), whereas addition of agonist SKF 81297 100 nanomolar in the continued presence of SCH 23390 resulted in a 66% loss of receptors from the cell surface (Figure 4, Bar 4 vs. Bar 6), up to a 78% loss of receptors with addition of SKF 81297 1 &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;micromolar&lt;/RTI&gt; (Figure 4, Bar 2 vs. Bar 6). </p><p> The effect of the antagonist SCH 23390 resulted in retention of receptor on the cell surface, indicating that this antagonist reduced receptor trafficking from the cell surface. The concomitant addition of agonist reduced the antagonist effect and accelerated the removal of the receptor from the cell surface in a dose-responsive manner. Thus interacting compounds can be detected by blockade of the effect of compounds that retain the NLS-containing receptor at the cell surface and &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;fluorometry&lt;/RTI&gt; can be utilized to quantify the effect. </p><p> Example 44: Expression of the dopamine D1 receptor with an inserted &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;(D1-&lt;/RTI&gt; NLS), treatment with (+) butaclamol 10 &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;micromolar&lt;/RTI&gt; and detection with radioligand binding

HEK cells were also transfected with DNA encoding EGFR-GFP (2 micrograms) and incubated for 24 hours. </p><p> EGFR-GFP was expressed on the cell surface in 73% of cells and 12% of cells had receptor in the nucleus. EGFR-NLS-GFP was expressed in the nucleus in 91 % of cells and 0% of cells had receptor on the cell surface.

HEK cells were transfected with DNA encoding SERT-NLS-GFP (2 micrograms of DNA) and treated with &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;sertraline&lt;/RTI&gt; (final concentration 500 nanomolar) for 48 hours. At 6,22, 30 and 42 hours after transfection, the cells were treated with sertraline.

Thus treatment with sertraline inhibited the SERT-NLS-GFP from translocating off the cell surface and trafficking to the nucleus. </p><p> Example 52: Expression of D1 dopamine receptor with an alternate NLS (D1-NLS2-GFP) and treatment with antagonists 
HEK cells were transfected with DNA encoding D1-NLS2-GFP (2 micrograms) and treated with (+) butaclamol or SCH 23390 (1 &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;micromolar)&lt;/RTI&gt; for 48 hrs. Nuclei were visualised with DsRed-nuc (2 micrograms). Cells were examined by &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;confocal&lt;/RTI&gt; microscopy. </p><p> With &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;butaclamol&lt;/RTI&gt; treatment, 81 % of cells had receptor on the cell surface or in cytoplasm and 19% of cells had receptor expression in the nucleus. With SCH 23390 treatment, 78% of cells had receptor on the cell surface or in cytoplasm and 22% of cells had receptor expression in the nucleus 
In the untreated cells, &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;89% of cells&lt;/RTI&gt; had receptor expression in the nucleus and cytoplasm. </p><p> Thus treatment with the dopamine D1 antagonists prevented D1-NLS2- GFP receptor translocation off the surface and trafficking to or toward the nucleus. </p><p> The present invention is not limited to the features of the embodiments described herein, but includes all variations and modifications within the scope of the claims. </p><p>&lt;Desc/Clms Page number 81&gt;</p><p>REFERENCES: <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Bailey et al., (2001), Expert Opinion in Therapeutics, v. &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;11,&lt;/RTI&gt; p. 1861-1887 &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;;.&lt;/RTI&gt;</bibl> </p><p><bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Barak et &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;al.,&lt;/RTI&gt; (1997), J. &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;Biol.&lt;/RTI&gt; Chem. , v. 272, p. 27497-27500</bibl>; <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Chen et &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;al.,&lt;/RTI&gt; (2000), Am.
