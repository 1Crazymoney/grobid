 </p><p> METHODS OF PRODUCING LIGNIN PEROXIDASE AND ITS USE IN SKIN 
AND HAIR LIGHTENING FIELD AND BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 
The present invention relates to methods of producing lignin peroxidase and its use in skin and hair lightening. </p><p> Melanin 
The color of human skin and hair is governed by the quantity, quality, and distribution of melanin, a pigment which is also present in plants and microorganisms. </p><p> The synthesis of melanin initiates from the precursor L-tyrosine which is transformed into a second precursor dopaquinone via the action of tyrosinase. In the biosynthesis of mammalian melanin this intermediate may be polymerized via two major pathways (Figure 1). Intramolecular &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;nucleophilic&lt;/RTI&gt; addition of the amino group gives rise to the indole derivative leucodopachrome which, following polymerization, yields the dark brown to black pigment eumelanin. In the presence of thiol compounds thioesther derivatives of dopa are formed ; the reaction with cystine yields &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;cysteinyldopa,&lt;/RTI&gt; which following further oxidation and polymerization yields the yellow to redish brown pigment phaeomelanin. Consequently, eumelanin is mainly composed of 5, &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;6-dihydroxyindole&lt;/RTI&gt; (DHI) and 5,6-dihydroxyindole-2- carboxylic acid (DHICA) units, whereas phaeomelanin mainly contains benzothiazine units (Alaluf &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;et al.,&lt;/RTI&gt; 2001). The availability and mutual ratio of these two pigments influences the chemical composition of the polymeric pigment. </p><p> Synthesis of melanin takes place in granules, which are referred to as melanosomes (Cooksey et al., 1997) which are present in melanocyte cells present in the epidermal basal layer; synthesis of melanin in these cells is induced by ultraviolet (UV) light. Following synthesis, melanin migrates to epidermal cells and is dispersed therein, where melanin is decolored following dermal metabolism and then scaled off in the form of dirt at the time of skin renewal. Melanin has a clinical importance since it protects the skin from adverse effects caused by UV light. </p><p>However, high levels of melanin can result in unwanted skin and hair darkening, while the heterogeneous distribution thereof can lead to chloasma and freckling which can be aesthetically displeasing. </p><p>&lt;Desc/Clms Page number 2&gt;</p><p> &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;Lighterziug&lt;/RTI&gt; products 
Skin lightening products have become increasingly popular in the past few years. The main purpose of skin lightening products is to lighten or whiten the skin or to treat pigmentation disorders such as chloasma, freckles, pregnancy marks and age spots. Several types of skin lightening products are presently available. </p><p> Products based on the degeneration and death of pigment cells typically include harsh chemicals, such as hydroquinone, &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;4-isopropylcatechol,&lt;/RTI&gt; and hydroquinone monobenzyl ether, that promote skin whitening and skin lightening or fade out skin pigmentation. Such products are typically inefficient and may be harmful to the skin since a continuous external application of these products can lead to permanent &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;leucoderma&lt;/RTI&gt; and side effects such as dyschromatosis and rash. </p><p> Other lightening products are based on the inhibition of tyrosinase, the enzyme that transforms the precursor L-tyrosine into a second precursor dopaquinone. This group of products includes Arbutin, a glucose hydroquinone compound which is capable of inhibiting tyrosinase by chelating copper ions thereby suppressing the tautomerization from Dopachrome to DHICA. </p><p> Melanostat is another lightening product that acts through tyrosinase. </p><p>Melanostat is a synthetic peptide that functions in deactivating melanogenesis in melanocytes. </p><p> Several antioxidant compounds that can inhibit the production of melanin are also utilized in lightening products. Since the synthesis of melanin involves an oxidation reaction, blocking the oxidation at various points from &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;tyrosine/DOPA&lt;/RTI&gt; to melanin ultimately inhibits the synthesis of melanin. </p><p> One antioxidant which is utilized to block melanin synthesis is L-Ascorbic (Vitamin &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;C)&lt;/RTI&gt; which acts as a reducing agent on melanin intermediates and blocks oxidative reactions; other antioxidants utilized by lightening products include bioflavonoids which are typically extracted from mulberry or licorice. </p><p> Hair lightening products act on the melanin inside the hair cortex. There are several chemicals that can lighten hair, among these are included hydrochloric acid, sodium hypochlorite and hydrogen peroxide. </p><p> The most commonly used chemical for lightening hair is hydrogen peroxide. </p><p>To maintain desired effectiveness, solutions of hydrogen peroxide must be stabilized using compounds such as acetanilide, dilute acids, colloidal silica, p- </p><p>&lt;Desc/Clms Page number 3&gt;</p><p> hydroxybenzoates, oxyquinoline sulfate, phenacetin, and tin compounds (sodium stannate, stannic hydroxide, stannous octoate). Before hair is lightened, ammonia is added to the hydrogen peroxide solution to enhance penetration of hydrogen peroxide through the cuticle, the outer layer of the hair, and to thus accelerate the oxidation reaction. </p><p> While reducing the present invention to practice, the present inventors have uncovered that Lignin peroxidase isoenzyme HI can oxidize melanin in vitro and can further lighten skin and hair in vivo. </p><p> Thus, the present invention provides cosmetic compositions and methods which are highly suitable for skin and hair lightening. </p><p>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The invention is herein described, by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings. With specific reference now to the drawings in detail, it is stressed that the particulars shown are by way of example and for purposes of illustrative discussion of the preferred embodiments of the present invention only, and are presented in the cause of providing what is believed to be the most useful and readily understood description of the principles and conceptual aspects of the invention. In this regard, no attempt is made to show structural details of the invention in more detail than is necessary for a fundamental understanding of the </p><p>&lt;Desc/Clms Page number 8&gt;</p><p> invention, the description taken with the drawings making apparent to those skilled in the art how the several forms of the invention may be embodied in practice. </p><p> In the drawings: 
FIG. &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;1&lt;/RTI&gt; is a prior art schematic illustration of the biosynthesis of mammalian melanin adopted from &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;Alaluf et al.,&lt;/RTI&gt; 2001. </p><p> FIG. 2 illustrates the stirred tank reactor (STR) for the production of lignin peroxidase by P/anerochaete &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;ch7ysosporiwn&lt;/RTI&gt; immobilized on polyurethane foam. </p><p> FIG. 3 illustrates LIP activity in a fermentor culture of P. &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;chrysosporiurrz&lt;/RTI&gt; as a function of culture age. &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;P.&lt;/RTI&gt; &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;chrysosporium&lt;/RTI&gt; was grown in an STR fermentor as described in Example 1 of the Examples section and LIP activity was assayed in the extracellular fluid by following the oxidation of veratryl alcohol to veratryl aldehyde as described in Examples. Error bars represent standard deviations of 3 replicate experiments. </p><p> FIG. 4 illustrates the oxidation of melanin, at an initial concentration of 70.5 &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;Ag/ml,&lt;/RTI&gt; by LIP (0.48 &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;uM)&lt;/RTI&gt; as a function of increasing concentrations of hydrogen peroxide in the presence of 1.5 mM veratryl alcohol in 50 mM tartrate buffer, at pH 3.5. Oxidation of melanin was determined by measuring its absorbance at 460 nm, at the beginning of the enzymatic reaction and after 160 seconds, and the percentages of oxidized melanin were calculated. The error bars represent standard deviations of 3 replicate experiments. </p><p> FIG. 5 illustrates the effect of increasing concentrations of hydrogen peroxide on the oxidation of melanin by LIP. Degree of oxidation of melanin is visualized by decrease in color intensity in comparison to the enzymatic reaction without the inclusion of hydrogen peroxide (0 &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;aM).&lt;/RTI&gt; Numbers below the picture indicate concentrations of H202 expressed in &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;pM.&lt;/RTI&gt; </p><p> FIG. 6 illustrates the degree of oxidation of different concentrations of melanin by LIP (0. &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;48&lt;/RTI&gt; uM) in 50 mM tartarate buffer at pH 3.5 in the presence of veratryl alcohol (1.5 mM) and hydrogen peroxide (600 uM). Error bars represent standard deviations of 3 replicate experiments. </p><p> FIG. 7 illustrates the degree of oxidation of melanin as a function of LIP concentrations. Oxidation of melanin (70 &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;llg/ml)&lt;/RTI&gt; was performed by increasing concentrations of LIP in the presence of veratryl alcohol (1.5 mM) and hydrogen </p><p>&lt;Desc/Clms Page number 9&gt;</p><p> peroxide &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;(700, uM)&lt;/RTI&gt; in 50 mM tartrate buffer at pH 3.5. Error bars represent standard deviations of 3 replicate experiments. </p><p> FIGs. 8a-b illustrate visualization of the oxidation of melanin by LIP when used in a cream formulation. Decolorization of melanin is observed after the addition of the activator cream to the LIP cream (Figure &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;8b)&lt;/RTI&gt; but not in the presence of the LIP cream alone (Figure &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;8a).&lt;/RTI&gt; </p><p> FIGs. 9a-b illustrate the effect of LIP cream on skin whitening. Shown is a photograph of a woman's hand taken one week following the application of LIP (twice daily) in a cream formulation. The area treated with LIP (Figure 9a, circled in black) is much lighter than the rest of the skin in the hand (Figure 9b). </p><p> FIG. 10 illustrates the effect of LIP on hair bleaching in vivo. A woman's hair was soaked for 1 hr in 50 mM carbonate buffer at pH 11.5. The hair was pre- incubated for 10 seconds with 25 U of LIP and immersed for 1 hr in tartarate buffer at pH 3.5 with veratryl alcohol (1.5 mM) and hydrogen peroxide (8.8 mM). A significant lightening effect was observed in the hair treated with LIP (Figure 10, right tube) as compared with the hair treated with the same solution without LIP (Figure 10, left tube). </p><p> FIGs. 11 &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;a-b&lt;/RTI&gt; are color photographs of the right forearm of study subject No. &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;1&lt;/RTI&gt; illustrating the effect of the LIP whitening cream on skin pigmentation.

The present invention is of methods and cosmetic compositions which can be used for lightening a skin region or hair of a subject. </p><p> Particularly, the methods of the present invention can be used for treating uneven skin complexions which result from hyperpigmentation-related medical conditions such as melasma, chloasma, age spots, freckles, ochronosis, and lentigo. </p><p> The principles and operation of the present invention may be better understood with reference to the drawings and accompanying descriptions. </p><p>&lt;Desc/Clms Page number 11&gt;</p><p> Before explaining at least one embodiment of the invention in detail, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited in its application to the details set forth in the following description or exemplified by the Examples. The invention is capable of other embodiments or of being practiced or carried out in various ways. </p><p>Also, it is to be understood that the phraseology and terminology employed herein is for the purpose of description and should not be regarded as limiting. </p><p> The degree of skin pigmentation is a source of concern among the general population. Some people suffer from age spots and pregnancy marks and wish such pigmented spots to be less pronounced. Other people have freckles, chloasma, melasma, ochronosis and lentigo that are usually treated with skin lightening products that lighten and smoothen the pigmentation of the skin. However, current skin lightening products are either harsh chemicals such as hydroquinone that can lead to permanent &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;leucoderma&lt;/RTI&gt; and side effects such as dyschromatosis and rash, or are not efficient enough in lightening the skin. Among them are the products based on the inhibition of the tyrosinase, the enzyme that transforms the precursor &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;L-&lt;/RTI&gt; tyrosine into a second precursor dopaquinone and therefore inhibit the biosynthesis of melanin. Other products are designed to block the oxidation reactions at various points from tyrosine/DOPA to melanin and ultimately inhibit the synthesis of melanin. The latter group of products includes antioxidants such as L-Ascorbic (Vitamin C) and bioflavonoids. </p><p> Hair lightening products utilize high concentrations of hydrogen peroxide in conjunction with ammonia. These products might be a source of discomfort to the treated subject. </p><p> As is clearly illustrated in the Examples section which follows, the present inventors have uncovered that lignin peroxidase, and in particular its &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;HI&lt;/RTI&gt; &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;isoform,&lt;/RTI&gt; can efficiently oxidize melanin and thus can be utilized to lighten skin or hair of a subject. </p><p> Although <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">U. S. Pat No. 5,578, 296</bibl> identified a melanin decomposing potency in the Basidiomycetes fungus and suggested the use of this fungus to treat chloasma and freckling, to date, the specific enzyme responsible for the melanin decomposition in the fungus has not been uncovered. </p><p> Thus according to one aspect of the present invention there is provided a method of lightening a skin region or hair of a subject. </p><p>&lt;Desc/Clms Page number 12&gt;</p><p> The method according to this aspect of the present invention is effected by applying to the skin region or hair of the subject at least one type of a lignin modifying enzyme in a manner suitable for oxidizing &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;a.&lt;/RTI&gt; pigment (e. g., melanin) contained within cells of the skin region or hair. </p><p> As used herein, the &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;phrase"lightening&lt;/RTI&gt; a skin region or hair"refers to reducing the tone or color of skin or hair by reducing the &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;pigmentive&lt;/RTI&gt; quality or concentration of melanin pigment contained therein. </p><p> As used herein, the phrase"subject"refers to mammals, typically human beings, and preferably those having excess skin or hair pigmentation, or skin imperfections such as freckles etc. </p><p> The lignin modifying enzyme utilized by the present invention is preferably lignin peroxidase, which plays a major role in lignin degradation. The active site amino sequence of this lignin modifying peroxidase and the mechanism by which it oxidizes substrates is similar to that of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and soybean peroxidase (SBP). Lignin modifying peroxidases are able to catalyze the oxidation of substrates with high redox potential. This unique ability is consistent with a heme active site of low electron density, which is indicated by high redox potential [<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Cai and Tien (1993). J Biotechnol 30: 79-90</bibl>]. </p><p> Although any &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;isoforms&lt;/RTI&gt; of lignin peroxidase known in the art can be utilized by the present invention (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Rothschild et al. , 1997, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 63: 857- 861</bibl>), the present invention preferably utilizes the H1 isoform, since as is illustrated in the Examples section which follows, this isoform exhibited melanin oxidation activities both in vitro and in vivo. </p><p> Several approaches can be used to prepare the lignin modifying enzyme utilized by the present invention. </p><p> For example, lignin peroxidase isoenzyme H1 can be prepared from the fungus &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;Plaafaerochaete&lt;/RTI&gt; &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;ch7ysosporiuffa.&lt;/RTI&gt; High levels of enzymatic activity of lignin peroxidase can be produced from the above fungus when grown in a stirred tank reactor (STR) fermentor while being immobilized on polyurethane foam or in suspension (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Dosoretz et al. , 1993, Appl Environ Microbiol. 59: 1919-26</bibl>). </p><p> According to preferred embodiments of the present invention the fermentor is connected to a cooling system to maintain a culturing temperature of &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;37  C&lt;/RTI&gt; and is stirred at speed of 50-300 rpm, more preferably, 100-200 rpm, most preferably at 160 </p><p>&lt;Desc/Clms Page number 13&gt;</p><p> rpm. In order to increase the yield of lignin peroxidase activity the fermentor is aerated at an aeration rate of 0.1-1 liter of air per liter of culture medium per minutes. </p><p>According to presently preferred configurations the &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;fermentor&lt;/RTI&gt; is aerated at an aeration rate of 0.2 liter of air per liter of culture medium per minute. </p><p> As is described under Materials and Experimental Methods of the Examples section which follows the &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;Phanerochaete ch7ysosposium&lt;/RTI&gt; is cultured under culturing conditions devoid of manganese ions and containing glycerol as a source of carbon. </p><p>Preferably, the glycerol of the present invention is provided at a concentration range of 3-20 grams per liter. According to presently preferred configurations the glycerol is provided at a concentration of 6 grams per liter. </p><p> During the purification process of lignin peroxidase isoenzyme Hl from the above fungus the enzymatic activity of the purified protein is been further tested by a change in absorbance at &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;310&lt;/RTI&gt; nm that occurs due to the oxidation of veratryl alcohol to veratryl aldehyde. </p><p> Since lignin peroxidase isoenzyme &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;H1&lt;/RTI&gt; can result from a post-translational de- phosphorylation of isoenzme H2 (Kuan and Tien, 1989), the lignin peroxidase used by the present invention can be prepared by dephosphorylating the lignin peroxidase isoenzyme H2. </p><p> Lignin modifying enzymes used by the present invention can also be extracted from bacterial cells modified to express the lignin modifying enzyme as disclosed in <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">US patent 5,200, 338</bibl>. For example, a bacterial cell, such as, E. coli, can be transformed with an expression vector including the LIP coding sequence (SEQ ID NO : &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;1)&lt;/RTI&gt; positioned under the regulatory control of a strong constitutive promoter (e. g. , SP6). Following expression, the bacterial cells can be &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;lysed&lt;/RTI&gt; and the LIP can be collected using chromatographic techniques (see, &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;<bibl next="bibl163" type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Billman-Jacobe,&lt;/RTI&gt; 1996, Curr.

Sci. 3: 28-31</bibl>, for further details). </p><p> Lignin modifying enzymes used by the present invention can also be extracted from mammalian cell lines such as HeLa cells. In this case the LIP coding sequence is positioned under a strong mammalian promoter (e. g., CMV) in a suitable expression vector (e. g. , pCDNA3. &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;1,&lt;/RTI&gt; Invitrogen Life Technologies, Frederick, MD, USA). Following transfection of HeLa cells with the expression vector, the LIP expression product can be extracted from the cells or medium (e. g. , by modifying the </p><p>&lt;Desc/Clms Page number 14&gt;</p><p> LIP sequence to include a secretion signal) by conventional purification and chromatography techniques (see <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Cunha and Aires-Barros, 2002. Mol. Biotechnol. 20: 29-40</bibl> for further details). </p><p> Although the lignin modifying enzyme can be applied to the skin or hair without necessitating co-application of additional compounds, the lightening capability of the lignin modifying enzyme LIP is enhanced when it is applied in the presence of an electron acceptor (i. e. a molecule capable of oxidizing a substrate), that serves as the oxidizing activator, and/or in the presence of phenolic compounds, such as veratryl alcohol (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Harvey et al. , 1992, Biochem Soc Trans 20: 345-9</bibl>), and veratrole that serve as the oxidizing mediators (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Ward et &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;al.,&lt;/RTI&gt; Enzyme and Microbial Technology (2002), 30: 490-498</bibl>). </p><p> Thus, according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the lignin modifying enzyme is applied with prior, concomitant or subsequent application of an oxidizing activator, such as hydrogen peroxide and an oxidizing mediator, such as, veratryl alcohol. </p><p> The lignin modifying enzyme can be applied to the skin or hair per se, however, in order to increase lightening efficiency, the lignin modifying enzyme is preferably included in a cosmetic composition which is formulated for specific use, such as, for example, general skin lightening, freckle lightening or hair lightening. </p><p>'These cosmetic compositions may include epidermal penetrants such as butylene glycol and transcutol, and hair penetrants such as alkanol amines. </p><p> As used herein cosmetic composition"refers to a preparation which includes the active ingredients described hereinabove &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;(e.&lt;/RTI&gt; g. , LIP) and additional chemical components such as physiologically suitable carriers and excipients, an oxidizing activator and/or an oxidizing mediator. The purpose of a cosmetic composition is to facilitate administration of the active ingredient to an organism. </p><p> Hereinafter, the phrases"suitable carrier"used refer to a carrier or a diluent that does not cause significant irritation to an organism and does not abrogate the biological activity and properties of the lignin modifying enzyme. </p><p> Herein the term"excipient"refers to an inert substance added to a cosmetic composition to further facilitate administration of an active ingredient. Examples, without limitation, of excipients include calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate, </p><p>&lt;Desc/Clms Page number 15&gt;</p><p> various sugars and types of starch, cellulose derivatives, gelatin, vegetable oils and polyethylene glycols. </p><p> The cosmetic composition may be applied in a local manner, for example, via administration of the cosmetic composition directly into a tissue region of a patient. </p><p>Suitable routes of administration may, for example, include topical, subcutaneous and intradermal injections. </p><p> Cosmetic compositions of the present invention may be manufactured by processes well known in the art, e. g. , by means of conventional mixing, dissolving, granulating, dragee-making, levigating, emulsifying, encapsulating, entrapping or &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;lyophilizing&lt;/RTI&gt; processes. </p><p> Cosmetic compositions for use in accordance with the present invention thus may be formulated in conventional manner using one or more physiologically acceptable carriers comprising excipients and auxiliaries, which facilitate processing of the active ingredients into preparations. Proper formulation is dependent upon the administration approach chosen. </p><p> For injection, the active ingredients of the cosmetic composition may be formulated in aqueous solutions, preferably in physiologically compatible buffers such as Hank's solution, Ringer's solution, or physiological salt buffer. </p><p> Alternatively, the active ingredient may be in a powder form for constitution with a suitable vehicle, e. g. , sterile, pyrogen-free water based solution, before use. </p><p> Determination of a therapeutically effective amount is well within the capability of those skilled in the art, especially in light of the detailed disclosure provided herein. </p><p> For any preparation used in the methods of the invention, the therapeutically effective amount or dose can be estimated initially from in vitro assays. As shown herein in the Examples section the concentrations of LIP and hydrogen peroxide could be optimized from in vitro assays and be further adapted for an in vivo use. In addition, a dose can be formulated in tissue cultures systems or in animal models to achieve a desired concentration or titer. Such information can be used to more accurately determine useful doses in humans. </p><p> Depending on the severity of the skin pigmentation disorder (e. g. , chloasma, melasma, ochronosis and lentigo) and the responsiveness of the skin, dosing can be of a single or a plurality of administrations, with course of treatment lasting from </p><p>&lt;Desc/Clms Page number 16&gt;</p><p> several days to several weeks or until cure is effected or diminution of the skin disorder is achieved. </p><p> The amount of a composition to be administered will, of course, be dependent on the subject being treated, the severity of the affliction, the manner of administration, the judgment of the prescribing physician, etc. </p><p> The lignin modifying enzyme included in the cosmetic composition of the present invention can be also provided at higher concentrations and be prescribed by a physician as a pharmaceutical composition to treat skin pigmentation disorders such as melasma, chloasma, ochronosis, and lentigo. </p><p> Following is a description of formulations incorporating a lignin modifying enzyme and formulated for skin or hair lightening. </p><p> Skin &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;Lighterzirzg&lt;/RTI&gt; 
To optimize and control skin lightening, the lignin modifying enzyme is preferably included in a cosmetic composition which is formulated for skin lightening purposes. </p><p> Since the skin lightening cosmetic composition of the present invention is utilized in vivo, the composition is preferably of high purity and substantially free of potentially harmful contaminants, e. g. , at least National Food (NF) grade, generally at least analytical grade, and preferably at least pharmaceutical grade. To the extent that a given compound must be synthesized prior to use, such synthesis or subsequent purification shall preferably result in a product that is substantially free of any potentially contaminating toxic agents that may have been used during the synthesis or purification procedures. </p><p>&lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt; Sctive iltgrediestts&lt;/RTI&gt; 
A lignin modifying enzyme, such as lignin peroxidase, is included in the cosmetic composition of the present invention at a concentration selected from a range of 1-100 &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;U/gr.&lt;/RTI&gt; According to presently known configurations the lignin modifying enzyme included in the cosmetic composition of the present invention is provided at a concentration selected from a range of 5-100 U/gr. It will be appreciated, that a preferred concentration of the lignin modifying enzyme is selected according to the specific use of the composition, thus, for general skin lightening, a preferred concentration of 5-20 &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;U/gr&lt;/RTI&gt; is utilized, while for freckle lightening, a broader concentration range of 5-100 U/gr is utilized. </p><p>&lt;Desc/Clms Page number 17&gt;</p><p> The electron acceptor (oxidizing activator), used by skin lightening cosmetic composition is preferably hydrogen peroxide provided at a concentration of at least 0.005 %. Hydrogen peroxide is stable, but will decompose under neutral or alkaline conditions to form water and an active species of oxygen. The active species of oxygen are very reactive. </p><p> The cosmetic composition is preferably buffered to a pH of 4 or lower since lignin peroxidase is only active at pH below 4, preferably at pH 2.5-3. 5 and hydrogen peroxide is stable at such pHs. </p><p> Any buffer capable of maintaining a pH of 4 or less may be employed. Thus, buffers employing acetic acid, tartaric acid, phosphoric acid or citric acid may be used by the skin lightening cosmetic composition. </p><p> As shown in the Examples section below, the hydrogen peroxide of the present invention is stabilized at pH 3.5 with phosphoric acid. </p><p> The oxidizing mediators used by the present invention are small aromatic molecules or more specifically &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;methoxylated&lt;/RTI&gt; compounds that increase the oxidative potential and the stability of the lignin modifying enzyme. The preferred oxidizing mediators used by the present invention are veratryl alcohol and veratrole. </p><p> As demonstrated in the Examples section, the veratryl alcohol included in the cosmetic composition of the present invention is preferably diluted in water at a concentration of at least 0.05 &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;%.&lt;/RTI&gt; </p><p>&lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt; Epdermal penetrazlts&lt;/RTI&gt; 
In order to enhance the percutaneous absorption of the active ingredients (e. g. , LIP), one or more of a number of agents can be added to the cosmetic composition including, but not limited to, dimethylsulfoxide, dimethylacetamide, &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;dimethylformamide,&lt;/RTI&gt; surfactants, azone, alcohol, acetone, propylene glycol and polyethylene glycol. </p><p> As illustrated in the Examples section which follows, the lignin modifying enzyme, LIP, and activator, hydrogen peroxide, are preferably mixed with epidermal penetrants such as butylene glycol and transcutol, respectively, in a manner and concentration optimized for enhancing skin penetration of the LIP. The butylene glycol used by the present invention is provided at a concentration of at least 1% and the transcutol is provided at a concentration of at least 3%. </p><p>&lt;Desc/Clms Page number 18&gt;</p><p> Carriers 
In addition to the pharmaceutically effective amount of an agent disclosed herein, the cosmetic composition of this aspect of the present invention also includes a &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;dermatologically&lt;/RTI&gt; acceptable carrier. </p><p> The &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;phrase"dermatologically&lt;/RTI&gt; acceptable carrier", refers to a carrier which is suitable for topical application onto the skin, &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;i. e.,&lt;/RTI&gt; keratinous tissue, has good aesthetic properties, is compatible with the active agents of the present invention and any other components, and is safe and non-toxic for use in mammals. An effective amount of carrier is selected from a range of about 50 % to about 99.99 %, preferably from about 80 % to about 99.9 %, more preferably from about 90 % to about 98 %, and most preferably from about 90 % to about 95 %, by weight, of the composition. </p><p>&lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt; Esltulsions&lt;/RTI&gt; 
The carrier utilized in the compositions of the invention can be in a wide variety of forms. These include emulsion carriers, including, but not limited to, oil- in-water, water-in-oil, water-in-oil-in-water, and oil-in-water-in-silicone emulsions, a cream, an ointment, an aqueous solution, a lotion or an aerosol. As will be understood by the skilled artisan, a given component will distribute primarily into either the water or oil/silicone phase, depending on the water solubility/dispersibility of the component in the composition. </p><p> Emulsions according to the present invention generally contain a pharmaceutically effective amount of an agent disclosed herein and a lipid or oil. </p><p>Lipids and oils may be derived from animals, plants, or petroleum and may be natural or synthetic (i. e., man-made). Preferred emulsions also contain a humectant, such as glycerin. Emulsions will preferably further contain from about 1 % to about 
10 %, more preferably from about 2 % to about 5 %, of an emulsifier, based on the weight of the carrier. Emulsifiers may be nonionic, anionic or cationic. Suitable emulsifiers are described in, for example, <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">U. S. Pat. No. 3,755, 560</bibl>, issued to Dickert, et al.

Anti-foaming agents include high molecular weight silicones and other materials well known in the art for such use. </p><p>&lt;Desc/Clms Page number 19&gt;</p><p> Suitable emulsions may have a wide range of viscosities, depending on the desired product form. Exemplary low viscosity emulsions, which are preferred, have a viscosity of about 50 centistokes or less, more preferably about 10 centistokes or less, most preferably about 5 centistokes or less. The emulsion may also contain an anti-foaming agent to minimize foaming upon application to the keratinous tissue. </p><p>Anti-foaming agents include high molecular weight silicones and other materials well known in the art for such use. </p><p> One type of emulsion is a water-in-silicone emulsion. Water-in-silicone emulsions contain a continuous silicone phase and a dispersed aqueous phase. </p><p>Preferred water-in-silicone emulsions of the present invention comprise from about 1 % to about 60 %, preferably from about 5% to about &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;40%,&lt;/RTI&gt; more preferably from about 10 % to about 20 %, by weight of a continuous silicone phase. The continuous silicone phase exists as an external phase that contains or surrounds the discontinuous aqueous phase described hereinafter. </p><p> The continuous silicone phase may contain a polyorganosiloxane oil. A preferred water-in-silicone emulsion system is formulated to provide an oxidatively stable vehicle for delivery of a pharmaceutically effective amount of an agent disclosed herein. The continuous silicone phase of these preferred emulsions comprises between about 50 % and about 99.9 % by weight of organopolysiloxane oil and less than about 50 % by weight of a non-silicone oil. In an especially preferred embodiment, the continuous silicone phase comprises at least about 50 %, preferably from about 60 % to about 99.9 %, more preferably from about 70 % to about 99.9 %, and even more preferably from about &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;80&lt;/RTI&gt; &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;%&lt;/RTI&gt; to about 99.9 %, polyorganosiloxane oil by weight of the continuous silicone phase, and up to about 50 &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;%&lt;/RTI&gt; non-silicone oils, preferably less about 40 %, more preferably less than about 30 %, even more preferably less than about 10 %, and most preferably less than about 2 %, by weight of the continuous silicone phase. These useful emulsion systems may provide more oxidative stability over extended periods of time than comparable water-in-oil emulsions containing lower concentrations of the polyorganosiloxane oil. Concentrations of non-silicone oils in the continuous silicone phase are minimized or avoided altogether so as to possibly further enhance oxidative stability of the active compound of the invention in the compositions. </p><p>&lt;Desc/Clms Page number 20&gt;</p><p>Water-in-silicone emulsions of this type are described in <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">U. S. Pat. No. 5,691, 380</bibl> to Mason et al. , issued Nov. 25,1997. </p><p> The organopolysiloxane oil for use in the composition may be volatile, non- volatile, or a mixture of volatile and non-volatile silicones. The term"nonvolatile"as used in this context refers to those silicones that are liquid under ambient conditions and have a flash point (under one atmospheric of pressure) of or greater than about 100 degrees Celsius. The &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;term"volatile"as&lt;/RTI&gt; used in this context refers to all other silicone oils. Suitable organopolysiloxanes can be selected from a wide variety of silicones spanning a broad range of volatilities and viscosities. Examples of suitable organopolysiloxane oils include polyalkylsiloxanes, cyclic polyalkylsiloxanes, and polyalkylarylsiloxanes, which are known to those skilled in the art and commercially available. </p><p> The continuous silicone phase may contain one or more non-silicone oils. </p><p>Concentrations of non-silicone oils in the continuous silicone phase are preferably minimized or avoided altogether so as to further enhance oxidative stability of the pharmaceutically effective agent in the compositions. Suitable non-silicone oils have a melting point of about &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;25  C&lt;/RTI&gt; or less under about one atmosphere of pressure. </p><p>Examples of non-silicone oils suitable for use in the continuous silicone phase are those well known in the chemical arts in topical personal care products in the form of water-in-oil emulsions, e. g. , mineral oil, vegetable oils, synthetic oils, semisynthetic oils, etc. </p><p> Useful topical compositions of the present invention comprise from about 30 % to about 90 %, more preferably from about 50 % to about 85 %, and most preferably from about 70 % to about 80 % of a dispersed aqueous phase. The term "dispersed phase"is well-known to one skilled in the art it implies that the phase exists as small particles or droplets that are suspended in and surrounded by a continuous phase. The dispersed phase is also known as the internal or discontinuous phase. The dispersed aqueous phase is a dispersion of small aqueous particles or droplets suspended in and surrounded by the continuous silicone phase described hereinbefore. The aqueous phase can be water, or a combination of water and one or more water soluble or dispersible ingredients. Nonlimiting examples of such optional ingredients include thickeners, acids, bases, salts, chelants, gums, water- </p><p>&lt;Desc/Clms Page number 21&gt;</p><p> soluble or dispersible alcohols and polyols, buffers, preservatives, sunscreening agents, colorings, and the like. </p><p> The topical compositions of the present invention typically comprise from &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;about-25&lt;/RTI&gt; % to about 90 %, preferably from about 40 % to about 80 %, more preferably from about 60 % to about 80 %, water in the dispersed aqueous phase by weight of the composition. </p><p> The water-in-silicone emulsions of the present invention preferably comprise an emulsifier. In a preferred embodiment, the composition contains from about 0.1 % to about 10 % emulsifier, more preferably from about 0.5 % to about 7.5 &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;%,&lt;/RTI&gt; most preferably from about 1 % to about 5 %, emulsifier by weight of the composition. </p><p>The emulsifier helps disperse and suspend the aqueous phase within the continuous silicone phase. </p><p> A wide variety of emulsifying agents can be employed herein to form the preferred water-in-silicone emulsion. Known or conventional emulsifying agents can be used in the composition, provided that the selected emulsifying agent is chemically and physically compatible with essential components of the composition, and provides the desired dispersion characteristics. Suitable emulsifiers include silicone emulsifiers, e. g. , organically modified organopolysiloxanes, also known to those skilled in the art as silicone surfactants, non-silicon-containing emulsifiers, and mixtures thereof, known by those skilled in the art for use in topical personal care products. </p><p> Useful emulsifiers include a wide variety of silicone emulsifiers. These silicone emulsifiers are typically organically modified organopolysiloxanes, also known to those skilled in the art as silicone surfactants.

Active &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;ingredients&lt;/RTI&gt; 
Hair lightening compositions formulated according to the teachings of the present invention include the oxidizing agent and mediator described above. </p><p> As demonstrated in the Examples section below, hair lightening can be achieved in the presence of 1.5 mM veratryl alcohol and 8.8 mM hydrogen peroxide in tartarate buffer at &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;a&lt;/RTI&gt; pH of 3.5. </p><p>&lt;Desc/Clms Page number 26&gt;</p><p>&lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt; E nollients&lt;/RTI&gt; 
The emollients include, but are not limited to, hydrocarbon oils and waxes, such as mineral oil, petrolatum, and the like, vegetable and animal oils and fats, such as olive oil, palm oil, castor oil, corn oil, soybean oil, and the like, and lanolin and its derivatives, such as lanolin, lanolin oil, lanolin wax, lanolin alcohols, and the like. </p><p>Other emollients include esters of fatty acids having 10 to 20 carbon atoms, such as including myristic, stearic, isostearic, palmitic, and the like, such as methyl myristate, propyl myristate, butyl myristate, propyl stearate, propyl &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;isostearate,&lt;/RTI&gt; propyl palmitate, and the like. Other emollients include fatty acids having 10 to 20 carbon atoms, including stearic, myristic, lauric, isostearic, palmitic, and the like. </p><p>Emollients also include fatty alcohols having ten to twenty carbon atoms, such as cetyl, myristyl, lauryl, isostearyl, stearyl and the like. </p><p> Although some are water soluble, polyhydric alcohols and polyether derivatives are included as emollients, including glycols, glycerol, sorbitol, polyalkylene glycols and the like, such as propylene glycol, dipropylene glycol, polyethylene glycol 200-500, and the like. The water soluble examples are preferred. </p><p>&lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt; Surfactants&lt;/RTI&gt; 
An &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;emulsifier/surfactant,&lt;/RTI&gt; preferably is also utilized by the hair lightening composition of the present invention. </p><p> Examples of surfactants include, but are not limited to, spolyoxyalkylene oxide condensation products of hydrophobic alkyl, alkene, or alkyl aromatic functional groups having a free reactive hydrogen available for condensation with hydrophilic alkylene oxide, polyethylene oxide, propylene oxide, butylene oxide, polyethylene oxide or polyethylene glycol Particularly effective are the condensation products of octylphenol with about 7 to about 13 moles of ethylene oxide, sold by the Rohm &amp; Haas Company under their trademark TRITON &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;100 (g)&lt;/RTI&gt; series products. </p><p> Other ingredients such as, fragrances, stabilizing agents, dyes, antimicrobal agents, antibacterial agents, anti agglomerates, ultraviolet radiation absorbers, and the like are also included in the hair lightening composition of the present invention. </p><p>&lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt; Cozzditionets&lt;/RTI&gt; 
A conditioner agent stable to acid hydrolysis, such as a silicone compound having at least one quaternary ammonium moiety along with an ethoxylated </p><p>&lt;Desc/Clms Page number 27&gt;</p><p> monoquat is preferably also utilized in order to stabilize and optionally thicken the hair lightening composition of the present invention. </p><p> An optional thickener also can be included to improve composition esthetics and facilitate application of the composition to the hair. Nonionic thickeners in an amount of 0% to about 3% by weight are preferred. Exemplary thickeners are methylcellulose, hydroxybutyl methylcellulose, hydroxypropylcellulose, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, hydroxyethyl ethylcellulose and hydroxyethylcellulose, di (hydrogenated tallow) &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;phthalic&lt;/RTI&gt; acid amide, crosslinked maleic anhydride-methyl vinyl ether copolymer, guar gum, xanthan gum and gum arabic. </p><p> The carrier of the conditioning composition is predominantly water, but organic solvents also can be included in order to facilitate manufacturing of the composition or to provide esthetic properties, such as viscosity control. Suitable solvents include the lower alcohols like ethyl alcohol and isopropyl alcohol; glycol ethers, like 2-butoxyethanol, ethylene glycol monoethyl ether, propylene glycol and diethylene glycol monoethyl ether or monomethyl ether; and mixtures thereof. Non- aqueous solvents can be present in the conditioning composition of the present invention in an amount of about 1 % to about 50 %, and in particular about 5% to about 25%, by weight of the total weight of the carrier in the composition. </p><p> Non-limiting conditioning agents which may be used in opaque conditioners include: stearyltrimethylammonium chloride; behenetrimethylammonium chloride; cetrimonium bromide; soytrimonium chloride; tallowtrimonium chloride; dihyrogenatedtallowdimethylammonium chloride; behentrimethylammonium methosulfate ; Peg-2 Oleammonium chloride; dihyrogenatedtallowdimethylammonium bromide; dihyrogenatedtallowdimethylammonium methosulfate; palmityltrimethylammonium chloride; hydrogenated tallowtrimethylammonium chloride; hydrogenated tallowtrimethylammonium bromide; dicetyidimethylammonium chloride; distearyldimethylammonium chloride; dipalmityidimethylammonium chloride; hydrogenated tallowtrimethylammonium methosulfate; cetrimonium tosylate: eicosyltrimethylammonium chloride, and &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;ditallowdirnethylammonium&lt;/RTI&gt; chloride. </p><p> Materials that can be used to opacity compositions of the invention include fatty esters, pacifying polymers, such as styrene polymers, like OPACIFIER 653 </p><p>&lt;Desc/Clms Page number 28&gt;</p><p> from Morton, International, Inc.; and fatty alcohols. The following is a non-limiting list of fatty alcohols: cetyl alcohol; stearyl alcohol; cetearyl alcohol; behenyl alcohol; and arachidyl alcohol. Conditioning compositions of the invention which are not clear also can include Lexamine S-13, dicetylammonium chloride, and &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;ceteareth 20.&lt;/RTI&gt; </p><p> Compositions of the present invention may, if desired, be presented in a dispenser device or a kit, along with appropriate instructions for use and labels indicating FDA approval for use in skin or hair lightening. </p><p> The kit for lightening a skin region or hair can include, for example, a container including a lignin modifying enzyme provided with suitable buffers, carriers, penetrants etc, and additional containers which include the oxidizing agent and mediator described above. </p><p> Lignin modifying enzymes can be also introduced into cells of the skin region by using molecular biology approaches that are known in the art. </p><p> Thus, according to yet another aspect of the present invention there is provided a method of lightening a skin region of a subject. The method according to this aspect of the present invention is effected by expressing within cells of the skin region, a lignin modifying enzyme in a manner suitable for oxidizing a pigment contained within cells of the skin region. </p><p> Such expression can be effected by transforming the cells of the skin with an expression vector which includes a lignin modifying enzyme coding sequence functionally linked to a promoter sequence. </p><p> To generate such an expression vector, a polynucleotide segment encoding a lignin modifying enzyme (e. g. , the LIP &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;H1 isoform,&lt;/RTI&gt; SEQ ID NO : &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;1),&lt;/RTI&gt; can be ligated into a commercially available expression vector system suitable for transforming mammalian cells and for directing the expression of the lignin modifying enzyme within the transformed cells. It will be appreciated that such commercially available vector systems can easily be modified via commonly used recombinant techniques in order to replace, duplicate or mutate existing promoter or enhancer sequences and/or introduce any additional polynucleotide sequences such as for example, sequences encoding additional selection markers or sequences encoding reporter polypeptides. </p><p> Suitable mammalian expression vectors for use with the present invention include, but are not limited to, pcDNA3, pcDNA3. 1 &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;(+/-),&lt;/RTI&gt; pZeoSV2 (+/-), &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;pSecTag2,&lt;/RTI&gt; pDisplay, &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;pEF/myc/cyto,&lt;/RTI&gt; &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;pCMV/myc/cyto,&lt;/RTI&gt; &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;pCR3. 1,&lt;/RTI&gt; which are available from </p><p>&lt;Desc/Clms Page number 29&gt;</p><p> &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;Invitrogen,&lt;/RTI&gt; pCI which is available from Promega, pBK-RSV and &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;pBK-CMV&lt;/RTI&gt; which are available from Stratagene, &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;pTRES&lt;/RTI&gt; which is available from Clontech, and their derivatives. </p><p> A suitable expression vector for use with this aspect of the present invention is an adenovirus based vector. Adenovirus vectors have been widely used for pharmaceutical applications including cutaneous gene therapy &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;(<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Ghazizadeh&lt;/RTI&gt; S, Taichman LB. (2000) Hum Gene Ther 11: 2247-51</bibl>; <bibl next="bibl167" type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Carter PJ, Samulski RJ.

Such complexes retain their binding specificity to the cell surface and are taken up into the cell where they enter the endosomal compartment via normal endocytotic processes. In addition, steps must be taken to avoid degradation of the DNA within the &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;endosome-lysosome.&lt;/RTI&gt; Cells can be treated with the lysosomatropic agent chloroquine during the transfection procedure. </p><p>Alternatively, the components of viruses that enter cells by endocysis and possess an endosomal"break out"capacity can be used. Replication defective adenovirus coupled to the ligand-DNA complex gives transfection efficiencies of virtually 100 &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;%&lt;/RTI&gt; on tissue culture cells &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;ira&lt;/RTI&gt; vitro. Preliminary studies have demonstrated the potential of this method to specifically target DNA to the cell type of choice in vivo (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Guy J, Drabek D, Antoniou M. (1995). Mol Biotechnol 1995 3: &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;237-48</bibl>).&lt;/RTI&gt; </p><p> Following expression within target cells, the electron acceptor and mediator described are preferably applied to the treated region in order to facilitate lightening. </p><p> Expressing the lignin modifying enzyme within target cells is particularly advantageous since it overcomes the need for intracellular delivery of the enzyme itself, thereby potentially enhancing lightening efficiency. </p><p> Additional objects, advantages, and novel features of the present invention will become apparent to one ordinarily skilled in the art upon examination of the </p><p>&lt;Desc/Clms Page number 30&gt;</p><p> following examples, which are not intended to be limiting.

There are more than 12 heme proteins displaying ligninolytic activity in the extracellular fluid of cultures of P. &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;ch7ysosporiurn&lt;/RTI&gt; BKM-F-1767. These can be classified into two types of glycosylated heme peroxidases, lignin peroxidase (LIP) and manganese peroxidase (MNP). Isoenzymes &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;H1,&lt;/RTI&gt; H2, H6, H7, H8 and H10 have been reported to be LIP and H3, H4, H5, and H9 have been identified as MNP (Farrell et al. , 1989). The LIP isoenzymes of P. &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;chrsosporium&lt;/RTI&gt; are encoded by a family of structurally related genes and are different in their physical characteristics, substrate specificity and stability (Farrell et al. , 1989; Stewart et al. , 1992). As part of the process leading to their secretion, LIP isoenzymes are proteolytically cleaved and glycosylated (Ghose, 1987; Ritch et al., 1991 ; Tien and Kirk, 1984). In addition, it has been reported that the LIP isoenzymes H2, H6, H8 and H10 are &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;phosphorylated&lt;/RTI&gt; at a mannose 6-phosphate moiety, contained in asparigine-linked oligosaccharide. </p><p>Analysis of aged extracellular fluid has led to the suggestion that isoenzyme HI is probably derived from posttranslational dephosphorylation of H2 &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;(Kuan&lt;/RTI&gt; and Tien, 1989). </p><p> The expression of the ligninolytic enzymes by P. &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;clarysosporium&lt;/RTI&gt; is an idiophasic event triggered by nitrogen or carbon limitation and is highly dependent on culture conditions and medium composition (Dosoretz and Grethlein, 1991; Faison and Kirk, 1985; Stewart et &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;al.,&lt;/RTI&gt; 1992; van der Woude et al. , 1993). The formation of LIP is particularly dependent on exposure of cultures to high oxygen tensions (Dosoretz et al. , 1990; Faison and Kirk, 1985). It has been proposed that oxygen transfer into stationary cultures is restricted, and consequently a high partial pressure of oxygen in the culture &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;headspace&lt;/RTI&gt; is needed to make sufficient oxygen </p><p>&lt;Desc/Clms Page number 32&gt;</p><p> available to the submerged hyphae (Leisola et al. , 1983; Michel et al. , 1992). LIP formation was observed in a culture that was exposed to air by immobilizing the fungus on a porous support in a non-immersed liquid culture, which improved the availability of oxygen to the fungus (Dosoretz et al. , 1990; Popp et al. , 1990). The concentration of &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;Mn2+&lt;/RTI&gt; in the medium adversely affects the formation of LIP and &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;MNP.&lt;/RTI&gt; While the formation of MNP is dependent on Mn, which enhances transcription of MNP, LIP formation is inhibited by Mn. Rothschild et al. , (1999) showed that in both nitrogen-limited and nitrogen-excess cultures of P. chrysosporium, the high oxygen level required for LIP formation could be replaced by Mn deficiency. </p><p> MATERIALS AND EXPERIMENTAL METHODS &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;Growth1&lt;/RTI&gt; of the fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium for the production fo &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;liguiez&lt;/RTI&gt; peroxidase-The fungus &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;Pharzerochaete&lt;/RTI&gt; &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;clzrysosporium&lt;/RTI&gt; BKMF-1767 (ATCC 24725) was maintained at &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;4  C&lt;/RTI&gt; on 2 % malt extract agar stock slants &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;(Difco,&lt;/RTI&gt; Detroit, MI, USA). </p><p> Preparation of spore suspension - Spores of the fungus were obtained by inoculating plugs from stock slants in Petri dishes containing autoclaved Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA) at a concentration of 39 &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;g/liter.&lt;/RTI&gt; PDA plates were then incubated for up to 2 weeks at &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;37  C.&lt;/RTI&gt; For preparation of spore suspension, PDA plates were overlayed with 0.9 % NaCI, the conidia suspension was filtered through sterile glass wool and the spore suspension collected.

OPTIMIZATION &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;OFMELANININANAQUEOUS PHASE OXIDATION&lt;/RTI&gt;
USING PURIFIED LIP
In order to optimize the conditions needed for melanin oxidation by LIP, optimal concentration of each of the critical components of the oxidation reaction was determined independently. </p><p> LIP &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;oxidization of iiielaiiiii in an aqueous phase, is a function of hydrogen&lt;/RTI&gt; peroxide concentration-Oxidation of melanin by LIP in an aqueous phase was first tested for correlation to hydrogen peroxide concentrations. A constant concentration of melanin (70.5  g/ml) was oxidized by 0. &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;48&lt;/RTI&gt; uM of purified LIP HI in the presence of 1.5 mM veratryl alcohol and with increasing concentrations of hydrogen peroxide. </p><p>Degree of oxidation was determined by measuring melanin's absorbance at 460 nm, before the addition of hydrogen peroxide and 160 sec after that, and was calculated in percentages. Generally, the oxidation of melanin increased with increasing concentrations of hydrogen peroxide up to a plateau that was obtained at 700-900 p. M of hydrogen peroxide (Figures 4). The effect of peroxide concentration on melanin oxidation is further demonstrated by comparison of reaction mixtures in Figure 5, where the reaction mixture is significantly lightened with increasing hydrogen peroxide concentrations. Thus, these results demonstrate that LIP oxidation of melanin in an aqueous phase is clearly dependent on hydrogen peroxide concentrations, optimal concentrations of hydrogen peroxide for the oxidation of melanin being in the range of &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;600 iM&lt;/RTI&gt; to 700 &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;pM.&lt;/RTI&gt; </p><p> LIP oxidation of melanin is a function of melanin's initial concentration in &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;are&lt;/RTI&gt; aqueous phase-In order to determine the optimal melanin concentration required for oxidation of melanin in an aqueous phase by LIP the oxidation reaction was further tested with increasing melanin concentrations. Oxidation of melanin took place by 0. 48 uM of purified LIP H1 in the presence of 1.5 mM veratryl alcohol and &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;600&lt;/RTI&gt; uM hydrogen peroxide. At initial melanin concentrations between 15 to 45 </p><p>&lt;Desc/Clms Page number 38&gt;</p><p> &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;p. g/ml,&lt;/RTI&gt; melanin oxidation by LIP was dependent on the initial concentrations of melanin. Maximal oxidation of melanin (60 %) was reached at melanin initial concentrations between 45 to 85 &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;llg/ml&lt;/RTI&gt; (Figure 6). Thus, melanin oxidation by LIP is clearly independent of initial melanin concentrations, beyond 45 &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;llg/ml&lt;/RTI&gt; &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt; Melanin oxidation of LIP is partially dependent on LIP concentration in an&lt;/RTI&gt; aqueous phase-To further optimize the conditions for melanin oxidation, the effect of LIP concentration on melanin oxidation was tested with optimal concentrations of melanin &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;(70 gg/ml),&lt;/RTI&gt; hydrogen peroxide &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;(700&lt;/RTI&gt; uM) and veratryl alcohol (1.5 mM). </p><p>Melanin oxidation was drastically increased from 10 to 60% when LIP concentration was increased from 0. 25 uM to 0.40 &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;uM.&lt;/RTI&gt; However, beyond LIP concentration of 0.50 uM no change in melanin oxidation was observed (Figure 7). Thus, the optimal range of LIP concentrations for melanin oxidation in &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;Vit10&lt;/RTI&gt; is 0. &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;40-0. 50, uM.&lt;/RTI&gt; </p><p> EXAMPLE &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;3&lt;/RTI&gt; &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt; OXIDA TION OF MELANIN USING LIP INA CREAM FORMULATION&lt;/RTI&gt; 
To further substantiate the ability of LIP isoenzyme H1 to oxidize melanin and as an intermediate step towards skin lightening in vivo, the LIP activity was tested in a cream formulation on melanin solubilized in an aqueous phase. </p><p> Melanin in an aqueous &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;phase is oxidized by LIP in a creazzz formulation-&lt;/RTI&gt; Two types of cream were prepared: the enzyme cream comprising the LIP isoenzyme H1 fraction (25 units/gr cream) and veratryl alcohol (6 &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;mmole/Kg&lt;/RTI&gt; cream), and the activator cream comprising hydrogen peroxide (3.52 &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;mmole/Kg&lt;/RTI&gt; cream). For determination of LIP activity in a cream formulation the enzyme cream (0.3 gr) was first mixed with melanin (140 &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;ug/ml)&lt;/RTI&gt; and a grayish black color was observed (Figure 8a). When the activator cream (0.3 gr) was added to the enzyme cream already containing melanin, the color was immediately changed to beige (Figure &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;8b).&lt;/RTI&gt; These results demonstrate that LIP in a cream formulation is highly efficient in melanin &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;decolorization&lt;/RTI&gt; and can further be tested on human skin. </p><p>&lt;Desc/Clms Page number 39&gt;</p><p> EXAMPLE 4 IN VIVO &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;SKINAND HAM LIGHTENING BYPURIFIED LIP Hl INA CREAM&lt;/RTI&gt;

To test the ability of LIP to lighten skin and hair in vivo the enzyme in a cream and aqueous formulations was added to skin and hair, respectively. </p><p> LIP in a cream formulation lightens skin in vivo - To test the ability of LIP in a cream formulation to lighten skin in vivo, the enzyme cream was applied and absorbed by the skin and then the activator cream was applied four times in 5 min intervals. When repeated twice a day for one week a significant lightening of the treated skin areas was observed (Figure 9). When skin color of two areas of the treated hand was quantitated using a Minolta chromameter, a clear skin-lightening effect of two week's application of LIP cream was observed (Table &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;1,&lt;/RTI&gt; % change). </p><p>Thus, these results demonstrate that LIP, prepared in an easy to apply cream formulation can simply and efficiently lighten skin in vivo, and that LIP prepared as detailed herein may be further adapted for other in vivo lightening applications. </p><p> TABLE 1 &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt; QUANTIFICATION OFSKINLIGHTENINGIN VIVO&lt;/RTI&gt;

Area I corresponds to the circled area in Figure 9, area II corresponds to data not shown. </p><p> LIP in an aqueous formulation lightens hair in vivo - Lightening of pigmentation is often required in melanin-rich tissues other than skin. To further test its in vivo lightening effects, LIP was applied on human hair. Before LIP application, the hair was first immersed for 1 hr in 50 mM carbonate buffer at pH 11.5 and then transferred to another tube containing LIP (25 &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;U/20&lt;/RTI&gt; &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;jul&lt;/RTI&gt; in water). The hair was incubated with LIP for 10 seconds and then transferred into tartarate buffer </p><p>&lt;Desc/Clms Page number 40&gt;</p><p> at pH 3.5 in the presence of veratryl alcohol (1.5 mM) and hydrogen peroxide (8.8 mM). A significant lightening effect was observed within 1 hr in the presence of LIP (Figure 10, right tube) as compared with the hair treated in the same solution but without. LIP (Figure 10, left tube). Thus, these results demonstrate that in the presence of very low concentrations of hydrogen peroxide LIP in an aqueous formulation can efficiently lighten hair in vivo. </p><p> EXAMPLE &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;5&lt;/RTI&gt; 
SCALING UP OF LIP &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;PREPARA TIONPROCESS&lt;/RTI&gt; 
In order to produce large quantities of lignin peroxidase (LIP) useful for commercial purposes LIP was purified from the &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;P.&lt;/RTI&gt; &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;ch7ysosporium&lt;/RTI&gt; fungus using a scaled up protocol. </p><p> &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;Light&lt;/RTI&gt; &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;activity of LIP obtaiyzed usiizg&lt;/RTI&gt; a &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;scaled-up fermentation protocol-&lt;/RTI&gt; Fermentation was performed in a 100 L fermentor using 90 L fermentation medium as described in the Methods section hereinabove. Fermentation conditions included agitation of 160 rpm and air flow of 0.2 vvm. Inoculation was performed in the same way as in the 10 L fermentor which is described in the Methods section hereinabove. </p><p>Following 7 days of growth the measured LIP activity was 1600 &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;units/liter.&lt;/RTI&gt; </p><p> These results demonstrate that large quantities and high catalytic activities of LIP can be produced from the P. &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;chfysosporiunz futzgus using&lt;/RTI&gt; large fermentors and the scaled up protocol of the present invention. </p><p> &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;EXAMPLE&lt;/RTI&gt; 6 &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt; 
DERMATOLOGICAL TESTES FOR THE LIP CREAM : HYPOALLERGENIC,&lt;/RTI&gt; 
SENSITIVE SKIN, AND SENSITIZING AND CHALLEGING TESTS ON 
NORMAL SKIN 
To characterize the dermatological properties of the LIP cream and as a prerequisite for use as a cosmetic product the LIP cream was subjected to several dermatological tests: an hypoallergenic test, a sensitizing and challenging test on normal skin, and a sensitizing and challenging test on sensitive skin. </p><p> Methods 
Study subjects for dermatological tests on normal skin: The study included 50 volunteers, 9 males and &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;41&lt;/RTI&gt; females, in a range of ages from 18 to 64 years. The </p><p>&lt;Desc/Clms Page number 41&gt;</p><p> volunteers were in a good general health and free of any visible skin disease or anomaly in the area to be patched. Each study subject was required to read, understand and sign an informed consent statement. The exclusion criteria were the following: pregnant or nursing women, subjects suffering from serious or progressive diseases &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;and/or&lt;/RTI&gt; pathology on the treated zone, subjects using a treatment (e. g., retinoids, steroids) and/or modifiers of the cutaneous hydration, subjects with unstable weight or excessive use of alcohol or tobacco. </p><p> A summary of the characteristics of the study subjects is presented in Table 2 hereinbelow. </p><p> Table 2

Study subjects &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;for the dermatological test Ot seslsitive skiBt-A&lt;/RTI&gt; total of 50 subjects, 6 males and 44 females completed the test: 22 subjects were in the range of 18 to 35,11 subjects in the range of 36 to 45, and 17 subjects in the range of 46 to 65. </p><p> Associated &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;treatmestt dusi lg tAte study-No&lt;/RTI&gt; water was applied to the test site during application of the patch; no systemic or topical treatment likely to modify the skin was permissible; no use of &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;dermopharmaceutical&lt;/RTI&gt; or cosmetic products, including cleansing products, was permissible on the zones being evaluated. </p><p> Patch preparation-For the hypoallergenic test, 2 mg of the LIP cream of the present invention was placed in a Curates F adhesive strip (Lohmann &amp; Rauscher International GmbH &amp; &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;Co.&lt;/RTI&gt; KG, Rengsdort). For the &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;dermatological&lt;/RTI&gt; tests and sensitive skin tests each patch included 0.07-0. 1 grams of the LIP cream in the Curatestg F adhesive strip. </p><p> The &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;Draize&lt;/RTI&gt; Repeated Insult patch test was carried out essentially as described in"Appraisal of the Safety of Chemicals in Foods, Drugs and Cosmetics" by &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;J.&lt;/RTI&gt; H. Draize (published by the Association of Food and Drug Officials of the United States). </p><p>&lt;Desc/Clms Page number 42&gt;</p><p> &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;InductioBt&lt;/RTI&gt; phase-The patch was applied on designated contact sites and remained in place for 24 hours. At the end of this period the patch was removed and the site was examined for any dermal response. The study subjects rested for 24 hours, after which the skin site was examined again. A patch was then applied to the same site as previously used. The second application was identical to the first and remained in place 24 hours. This procedure was repeated nine times. The study subjects examined the site for any dermal response and reported their observations prior to the next application. The same site was used throughout the study. Each application was put on and removed by the staff of the Institute of Skin Research (Tel Aviv, Israel). A quality control person monitored the adherence to study protocol. </p><p> &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;CAzallege phase-Following&lt;/RTI&gt; the &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;9th&lt;/RTI&gt; application, a rest period of 2 weeks elapsed after which a challenge application was applied in the same manner and to the same site used during the induction phase. The challenge application was removed after 24 hours and the site was examined and graded for signs of irritation or sensitization. A follow-up examination was conducted at 48 hours after the challenge application (24 hours after patch removal), as well as at 48 and 72 hours after removal. </p><p> Grading scale-The results of the induction and challenge tests were graded using the following scale:"0"= No visible reaction &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;;" ?" =&lt;/RTI&gt; doubtful reaction, &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;i. e.,&lt;/RTI&gt; faint, minimal erythema, no infiltration &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;;"1"=&lt;/RTI&gt; weak positive reaction, i. e. , erythema, infiltration, no discrete papules &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;;"2"= strong&lt;/RTI&gt; positive reaction, i. e. , erythema, infiltration, papules, discrete vesicles &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;;"3"=&lt;/RTI&gt; extra positive reaction, i. e. , intense erythema, infiltration, coalescing vesicles/bullous reaction;"IR"= irritation reaction, i. e. , discrete erythema without &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;infiltration/patchy&lt;/RTI&gt; follicular &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;erythema/hemorrhagic&lt;/RTI&gt; and follicular pustules;"NT"= not tested. </p><p>&lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt; Dermatological tests results&lt;/RTI&gt; &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;Hypoallergenc&lt;/RTI&gt; test-In this test the reaction to the application of a patch containing the LIP cream was recorded following 20 minutes, 24 hours and 48 hours of patch removal. As is shown in Table 3 hereinbelow, in all 50 study subjects there was no visible skin reaction to the LIP cream. </p><p>&lt;Desc/Clms Page number 43&gt;</p><p> Table 3 &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt; Results of hypoallergezlic test&lt;/RTI&gt;

Table 4: Grading scores following each patch application in the induction phase (scoring results Nos. 1-9) and the challenge phase (scoring results No. 10). M = male ; F =female. </p><p> Dermatological test on sensitive skin - To further characterize the sensitizing properties of the LIP cream an irritation patch test was carried out on 50 healthy volunteers with sensitive skin. At the pretest, 11 subjects were found to have various degrees of stinging: 2 with severe sensitive skin, &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;8&lt;/RTI&gt; with moderately sensitive skin and 1 with slightly sensitive skin. The irritating patch including the LIP cream was placed on the back of the volunteers for 48 hours. The tested area was inspected following 1 hr, 24 hrs and &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;48&lt;/RTI&gt; hours and it was found that there was no skin reaction in any of the 50 volunteers. </p><p> These results rule out hypoallergenic and irritating reactions to the LIP cream in normal and sensitive skin. Moreover, the results of the Repeated Insult patch test further suggest the use of the LIP cream as a safe cosmetic composition. </p><p> EXAMPLE 7
LIP CREAM IS HIGHLY EFFICIENT IN WHITENING SKIN
PIGMENTATION
The effect of the LIP cream in skin whitening was compared to prior art creams in a double blind study. </p><p>&lt;Desc/Clms Page number 46&gt;</p><p> Study design 
Study subjects-The study included 12 healthy males and females at ages 18- 65 of Asian origin which were free of disease, with no history of skin diseases or atopic diseases (asthma, hay fever, allergic rhinitis) and no known sensitivity to any of the substances being tested and any of the components of the cosmetic preparation. The study excluded candidates who were undergoing treatment with anti-inflammatory drugs, antihistamines, or corticosteroids for systemic or local treatment, unless the treatment was interrupted two weeks in the case of systemic treatment and three days in the case of local treatment prior to enrolling in the study. </p><p>Also excluded from study candidates with cancer, kidney disease or liver disease at any stage of diagnosis or treatment, as well as pregnant and breast-feeding women. </p><p> Study protocol-The study included two types of creams which were applied in a double blind fashion each on one upper forearm: the whitening cream of the present invention which includes LIP as the active ingredient, and a marketed product, 2 % Hydroquinone (Esomed Medibrands, Israel). The creams were applied twice a day &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;(i.&lt;/RTI&gt; e., morning and evening). The lower parts of the forearms remained untreated. Study subjects were examined by the staff of the Institute of Skin Research (Tel Aviv, Israel), at the beginning of the study (week 0), and following one, two and three weeks of cream application. At each examination skin pigmentation and side effects were recorded. </p><p> &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;Evaluation of skin pigmentatio7t-Skin&lt;/RTI&gt; pigmentation was evaluated using a Derma Spectrometer (Cortex Technology, Denmark), color photographs which were taken using the same distance and light exposure and visual inspection made by Prof. </p><p>Brenner (Head of the &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;Dermatological&lt;/RTI&gt; Department, Souraski Medical Center, Tel Aviv, Israel) and her team. </p><p> Study results 
The LIP &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;cream reduced skin pig) lentation after 3 weeks of application-To&lt;/RTI&gt; evaluate the effect of the LIP cream in skin whitening the LIP cream was applied twice a day on the upper part of the right arm of 12 healthy volunteers. As is shown in Figures &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;l la-b&lt;/RTI&gt; and 13a-b which include representative photographs of two study subjects, following three weeks of cream application the upper part of the right forearm appeared much whiter than prior to cream application. </p><p>&lt;Desc/Clms Page number 47&gt;</p><p> The LIP cream &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;is tnore efficient in skin whitening tlzan tlze Hydroquizone&lt;/RTI&gt; cream-The effect of the LIP cream in reducing skin pigmentation was compared with that of 2 % Hydroquinone. Following 21 days of cream application the pigmentation of the LIP-treated area of study subject No. &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;1&lt;/RTI&gt; was reduced by 3.33 units (Figure 12a blue columns and Figure 12c blue curve). On the other hand the pigmentation of the untreated area in the same forearm was reduced by 1.13 units (Figure 12a, light blue columns). On the other hand, following 21 days of treatment using the Hydroquinone cream the pigmentation of the treated area was reduced by only 1 unit (Figure 12b pink columns and Figure 12c pink curve). Similar effects were observed in other study subjects as is shown in Figures 14a-c. When results from all 12-study subjects were summarized it was found that the average reductions in skin pigmentation were 1.57 units (Figure 15a, blue curve) and 1.49 (Figure &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;15a,&lt;/RTI&gt; pink curve) units in LIP-treated and Hydroquinone-treated forearms, respectively. </p><p>Moreover, when the reductions in skin pigmentations were normalized to the initial skin pigmentation the average decreases in skin pigmentations were 4.3 % (Figure &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;15b,&lt;/RTI&gt; blue curve) and 3. &lt;RTI ID=0.0&gt;8&lt;/RTI&gt; % (Figure 15b, pink curve) for the LIP-treated and Hydroquinone-treated forearms, respectively. </p><p> Altogether, these results demonstrate that the LIP cream is highly efficient in reducing skin pigmentation. Moreover, these results suggest that the relative whitening effect of the LIP cream is higher than the relative whitening effect observed using the 2 % Hydroquinone cream. </p><p> It is appreciated that certain features of the invention, which are, for clarity, described in the context of separate embodiments, may also be provided in combination in a single embodiment.
