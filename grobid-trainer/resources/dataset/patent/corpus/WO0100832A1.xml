 FIELD OF THE INVENTION
 The present invention relates generally to making Apo-2 ligand and Apo-2 ligand formulations using divalent metal ions, such as zinc or cobalt. The use of such Apo-2 ligand and Apo-2 ligand formulations having improved Apo-2L trimer formation and stability is also provided. The present invention also relates to Apo-2 ligand variants, particularly alanine substitution variants.</p><p> BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
 Control of cell numbers in mammals is believed to be determined, in part, by a balance between cell proliferation and cell death. One form of cell death, sometimes referred to as necrotic cell death, is typically characterized as a pathologic form of cell death resulting from some trauma or cellular injury. In contrast, there is another,"physiologic"form of cell death which usually proceeds in an orderly or controlled manner. This orderly or controlled form of cell death is often referred to as"apoptosis" [see, e. g., <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Barr et al., &lt;RTI ID=1.1&gt;Bio/Technoloev,&lt;/RTI&gt;

Apoptotic cell death naturally occurs in many physiological processes, including embryonic development and &lt;RTI ID=1.3&gt;clonal&lt;/RTI&gt;  selection in the immune system [<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Itoh et &lt;RTI ID=1.4&gt;al.,&lt;/RTI&gt;  Cell, 66: 233-243 (1991)</bibl>].</p><p> Various molecules, such as tumor necrosis factor-a ("TNF-a"), tumor necrosis &lt;RTI ID=1.5&gt;factor-X ("TNF-ss"or&lt;/RTI&gt;  &lt;RTI ID=1.6&gt;"lymphotoxin-a"),&lt;/RTI&gt;  &lt;RTI ID=1.7&gt;lytnphotoxin-a&lt;/RTI&gt;  &lt;RTI ID=1.8&gt;("LT-ss"),&lt;/RTI&gt;  CD30 ligand, CD27 ligand, CD40 ligand, OX-40 ligand, &lt;RTI ID=1.9&gt;4-1BB&lt;/RTI&gt;  ligand, &lt;RTI ID=1.10&gt;Apo-1&lt;/RTI&gt;  ligand (also referred to as Fas ligand or CD95 ligand), Apo-2 ligand (also referred to as TRAIL, &lt;RTI ID=1.11&gt;AIM-1&lt;/RTI&gt;  or AGP-1), and Apo-3 ligand (also referred to as TWEAK) have been identified as members of the tumor necrosis factor ("TNF") family of cytokines [See, e. g., <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Gruss and Dower, Blood, 85: 3378-3404 (1995)</bibl>;

A similar proline-rich region is found in TNFR2 but not in TNFRI.</p><p> The TNF family ligands identified to date, with the exception of &lt;RTI ID=2.43&gt;lymphotoxin-a,&lt;/RTI&gt;  are type 11 transmembrane proteins, whose C-terminus is extracellular. In contrast, most receptors in the TNF receptor (TNFR) family identified to date are type I transmembrane proteins. In both the TNF ligand and receptor families, however, homology identified between family members has been found mainly in the extracellular domain ("ECD"). Several of the TNF family cytokines, including &lt;RTI ID=2.44&gt;TNF-a,&lt;/RTI&gt;  &lt;RTI ID=2.45&gt;Apo-1&lt;/RTI&gt;  ligand and CD40 ligand, are cleaved &lt;RTI ID=2.46&gt;proteolytically&lt;/RTI&gt;  at the cell surface; the resulting protein in each case typically forms a homotrimeric molecule that functions as a soluble cytokine. TNF receptor family proteins are also usually cleaved &lt;RTI ID=2.47&gt;proteolytically&lt;/RTI&gt;  to release soluble receptor ECDs that can function as inhibitors of the cognate cytokines.</p><p> Recently, other members of the TNFR family have been identified.

Aside from containing four putative extracellular domains and a cytoplasmic death domain, DR6 is believed to contain a putative leucine-zipper sequence that overlaps with a proline-rich motif in the cytoplasmic region. The proline-rich motif resembles sequences that bind to src-homology-3 domains, which are found in many intracellular signal-transducing molecules.</p><p> A further group of recently identified TNFR family members are referred to as"decoy receptors," which are believed to function as inhibitors, rather than transducers of signaling.

 The present invention is based on the discovery that the inclusion of one or more divalent metal ions in methods or processes for making Apo-2 ligand, or formulations containing Apo-2 ligand, results in increased yield and stability of Apo-2 ligand trimers. It is presently believed that such inclusion of one or more divalent metal ions may also improve folding of Apo-2 ligand or Apo-2L trimer assembly upon expression in recombinant cell culture. In oxidative environments, free cysteines on Apo-2L monomers may form intermolecular disulfide bridges, giving rise to free-standing Apo-2L dimers as well as disulfide-linked Apo-2L dimer species within trimeric forms of Apo-2L. Such formation of Apo-2L dimers may lead to aggregation, precipitation, and/or inactivation of Apo-2L. The presence of divalent metal ions in the methods and formulations described herein may protect against such disulfide bond formation. It appears that inclusion of divalent metal ions during the process of synthesis and assembly of Apo-2L trimers may further improve accumulation and recovery of &lt;RTI ID=4.10&gt;properly&lt;/RTI&gt;  folded, homotrimeric Apo-2L. Applicants have found that Apo-2 ligand trimers are approximately &lt;RTI ID=4.11&gt;10-fold&lt;/RTI&gt;  more active (in cytotoxic activity in mammalian cancer cells) as compared to disulfide-linked Apo-2L dimers.</p><p> While the description of the invention herein is primarily directed to Apo-2 ligand, the use of divalent metal ions to make or stabilize trimers of various other proteins is contemplated. Such other proteins particularly include those proteins which require trimer formation for biological activity, for instance, various members of the TNF family.</p><p> In one embodiment, the invention provides a method of making Apo-2 ligand using one or more divalent ions. The methods include the steps of providing a host cell comprising a replicable vector containing a nucleic acid encoding Apo-2 ligand, providing culture media containing one or more divalent metal ions, culturing the host cell in the culture media under conditions sufficient to express the Apo-2 ligand, and recovering the Apo-2 ligand from the host cells or the cell culture media. Optionally, one or more divalent metal ions are used during the recovery or purification process.</p><p> In another embodiment, the invention provides a formulation comprising Apo-2 ligand and one or more divalent metal ions. The composition may be a pharmaceutically acceptable formulation useful, for instance, in inducing or stimulating apoptosis in mammalian cancer cells.</p><p> A further embodiment of the invention provides articles of manufacture and kits that include such Apo2 ligand formulations containing one or more divalent metal ions. The articles of manufacture and kits include a container, a label on the container, and a formulation contained within the container. The label on the container  
 indicates that the formulation can be used for certain therapeutic or non-therapeutic applications. The
 formulation contains Apo-2 ligand and one or more divalent metal ions.</p><p> In another embodiment, the invention provides Apo-2 ligand polypeptides made in accordance with the
 methods described herein. Such Apo-2 ligand polypeptides may comprise amino acids 114-281 of Figure 1
 (SEQ ID &lt;RTI ID=5.1&gt;NO:&lt;/RTI&gt;  &lt;RTI ID=5.2&gt;1),&lt;/RTI&gt;  amino acids 1-281 of Figure I (SEQ ID NO: &lt;RTI ID=5.3&gt;1),&lt;/RTI&gt;  as well as biologically active fragments or
 variants thereof.</p><p> In a still further embodiment, the invention provides Apo-2 ligand variants. Particularly, the invention
 provides Apo-2 ligand variants comprising one or more amino acid substitutions in the native sequence of Apo-2
 ligand (Figure 1; SEQ ID &lt;RTI ID=5.4&gt;NO:&lt;/RTI&gt;  &lt;RTI ID=5.5&gt;1).&lt;/RTI&gt;  Apo-2 ligand variants comprising alanine substitutions are provided in Table I
 below. The invention also provides nucleic acid molecules encoding such Apo-2L variants and vectors and host
 cells containing nucleic acid molecules encoding the Apo-2L variants.</p><p> BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE &lt;RTI ID=5.6&gt;DRAWINGS&lt;/RTI&gt;

 amino acid sequence (SEQ ID &lt;RTI ID=5.9&gt;NO:&lt;/RTI&gt;  1). The"N"at nucleotide position 447 (in SEQ ID &lt;RTI ID=5.10&gt;NO:&lt;/RTI&gt;  2) is used to indicate
 the nucleotide base may be a"T"or"G".</p><p> Figure 2 provides the crystal structure of Apo-2L. Figure 2A shows a view of the trimer along the three

In one embodiment, the polypeptide sequence comprises residues &lt;RTI ID=6.11&gt;114-281&lt;/RTI&gt;  of Figure I (SEQ ID &lt;RTI ID=6.12&gt;NO:&lt;/RTI&gt;  &lt;RTI ID=6.13&gt;1).&lt;/RTI&gt;  Optionally, the polypeptide sequence comprises residues 92-281 or residues 91-281 of Figure 1 (SEQ ID &lt;RTI ID=6.14&gt;NO:&lt;/RTI&gt;  1). The Apo-2L polypeptides may be encoded by the native nucleotide sequence shown in Figure I (SEQ ID &lt;RTI ID=6.15&gt;NO:&lt;/RTI&gt;  2). Optionally, the codon which encodes residue
Pro &lt;RTI ID=6.16&gt;19&lt;/RTI&gt;  (Figure 1; SEQ ID &lt;RTI ID=6.17&gt;NO:&lt;/RTI&gt;  2) may be"CCT"or"CCG". In another preferred embodiment, the fragments or variants are biologically active and have at least about 80% amino acid sequence identity, more preferably at least about 90% sequence identity, and even more preferably, at least 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99% sequence identity with any one of the above sequences. The definition encompasses substitutional variants of Apo-2 ligand in which at least one of its native amino acids are substituted by an alanine residue.

The definition also encompasses a native sequence Apo-2 ligand isolated from an Apo-2 ligand source or prepared by recombinant or synthetic methods. The Apo-2 ligand of the invention includes the polypeptides referred to as
Apo-2 ligand or TRAIL disclosed in &lt;RTI ID=6.18&gt;<bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">W097/01633</bibl>&lt;/RTI&gt;  published January 16,1997 and <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">W097/25428</bibl> published July 17,1997. The &lt;RTI ID=6.19&gt;terms"Apo-2&lt;/RTI&gt;  ligand"or"Apo-2L"are used to refer generally to forms of the Apo-2 ligand which include monomer, dimer or trimer forms of the polypeptide. All numbering of amino acid residues referred to in the Apo-2L sequence use the numbering according to Figure 1 (SEQ ID &lt;RTI ID=6.20&gt;NO:&lt;/RTI&gt;  &lt;RTI ID=6.21&gt;1),&lt;/RTI&gt;  unless specifically stated otherwise. For instance,"D203"or"Asp203"refers to the aspartic acid residue at position 203 in the sequence provided in Figure I (SEQ ID &lt;RTI ID=6.22&gt;NO:&lt;/RTI&gt;  1).</p><p> The term"Apo-2 ligand extracellular domain"or"Apo-2 ligand ECD"refers to a form of Apo-2 ligand which is essentially free of transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. Ordinarily, the ECD will have less than &lt;RTI ID=6.23&gt;1%&lt;/RTI&gt;  of such transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains, and preferably, will have less than 0.5% of such domains.  </p><p> The &lt;RTI ID=7.1&gt;term"Apo-2&lt;/RTI&gt;  ligand &lt;RTI ID=7.2&gt;monomer"or"Apo-2L&lt;/RTI&gt;  monomer"refers to a covalent chain of an extracellular domain
 sequence of Apo-2L.</p><p> The term"Apo-2 ligand &lt;RTI ID=7.3&gt;dimer"or"Apo-2L&lt;/RTI&gt;  &lt;RTI ID=7.4&gt;dimer"refers&lt;/RTI&gt;  to two Apo-2L monomers joined in a
 covalent linkage via a disulfide bond. The term as used herein includes free standing Apo-2L dimers and Apo
 2L dimers that are within &lt;RTI ID=7.5&gt;trimeric&lt;/RTI&gt;  forms of Apo-2L (i. e., associated with another Apo-2L monomer).</p><p> The term"Apo-2 ligand trimer"or"Apo-2L trimer"refers to three Apo-2L monomers that are non
 covalently associated.</p><p> "TNF family member"is used in a broad sense to refer to various polypeptides that share some
 similarity to tumor necrosis factor (TNF) with respect to structure or function. Certain structural and functional
 characteristics associated with the TNF family of polypeptides are known in the art and described, for example,
 in the above Background of the Invention. Such polypeptides include but are not limited to those polypeptides
 referred to in the art as TNF-alpha, TNF-beta, CD40 ligand, CD30 ligand, CD27 ligand, OX-40 ligand, &lt;RTI ID=7.6&gt;4-1BB&lt;/RTI&gt;

The control sequences that are suitable for prokaryotes, for example, include a promoter, optionally an operator sequence, and a ribosome binding site. Eukaryotic cells are known to utilize promoters, polyadenylation signals, and enhancers.</p><p> Nucleic acid is"operably linked"when it is placed into a functional relationship with another nucleic acid sequence. For example, DNA for a presequence or secretory leader is operably linked to DNA for a polypeptide if it is expressed as a preprotein that participates in the secretion of the polypeptide; a promoter or enhancer is operably linked to a coding sequence if it affects the transcription of the sequence; or a ribosome binding site is operably linked to a coding sequence if it is positioned so as to facilitate translation. Generally,   "operably linked"means that the DNA sequences being linked are contiguous, and, in the case of a secretory leader, contiguous and in reading phase. However, enhancers do not have to be contiguous. Linking is accomplished by ligation at convenient restriction sites.

 A novel cytokine related to the TNF ligand family, the cytokine identified herein as"Apo-2 ligand"has been described. The predicted mature amino acid sequence of human Apo-2 ligand contains 281 amino acids, and has a calculated molecular weight of approximately 32.5 kDa. The absence of a signal sequence and the presence of an internal hydrophobic region suggests that Apo-2 ligand is a type 11 transmembrane protein.</p><p>Soluble extracellular domain Apo-2 ligand polypeptides have also been described. See, e. g., <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">W097/25428</bibl> published July 17,1997. Apo-2L substitutional variants have further been described. Alanine scanning techniques have been utilized to identify various substitutional variant molecules having biological activity.</p><p>Particular substitutional variants of the Apo-2 ligand include those in which at least one amino acid is substituted by an alanine residue. These substitutional variants are identified, for example, as"D203A" ;"D218A"and "D269A."This nomenclature is used to identify Apo-2 ligand variants wherein the aspartic acid residues at positions 203,218, and/or 269 (using the numbering shown in Figure I (SEQ ID &lt;RTI ID=9.9&gt;NO:&lt;/RTI&gt;  &lt;RTI ID=9.10&gt;1))&lt;/RTI&gt;  are substituted by alanine residues. Optionally, the Apo-2L variants may comprise one or more of the alanine substitutions which are recited in Table I below.  </p><p> The x-ray crystal structure of the extracellular domain of &lt;RTI ID=10.1&gt;Apo-2&lt;/RTI&gt;  ligand is now provided in the present
 invention, and alanine-scanning mutagenesis has been performed to provide the mapping of its receptor contact
 regions. The structure obtained for Apo-2 ligand reveals a homotrimeric protein which contains a novel divalent
 metal ion (zinc) binding site that coordinates the interaction of the Apo-2 ligand trimer molecule's three
 subunits.</p><p> The x-ray structure of Apo-2L was determined by molecular replacement using a model of TNF-alpha

 form) and &lt;RTI ID=10.4&gt;1.3&lt;/RTI&gt;  Angstrom (for the D218A variant; 91-281 form). Like other members of the TNF family, Apo-2L
 appears to comprise a compact trimer formed of three jelly roll monomers which bury approximately &lt;RTI ID=10.5&gt;5100&lt;/RTI&gt; 
 &lt;RTI ID=10.6&gt;Angstrom2 (1700 Angstrom&lt;/RTI&gt;  per monomer) to form the globular trimer (See Figure 2A). The position of the
 core beta-strands was well conserved compared to the other structurally characterized members of the TNF
 family, TNF-alpha [Eck et &lt;RTI ID=10.7&gt;al.,&lt;/RTI&gt;  supra ; <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Jones et &lt;RTI ID=10.8&gt;al.,&lt;/RTI&gt;  Nature, 338: 225-228 (1989)</bibl>], TNF-beta [<bibl next="bibl7" type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Eck et &lt;RTI ID=10.9&gt;al.,&lt;/RTI&gt;  J.

 0.8 Angstrom when compared to the core strands of TNF-alpha or TNF-beta. None of the residues in the Apo
 2L trimer interface appear to be absolutely conserved across the sequences of the all the presently known human
 TNF family members; however, the hydrophobic chemical nature of these residues is preserved. (See Figure 3).</p><p> The conserved residues in the Apo-2L trimer interface cluster near the base (the widest part of the trimer) and
 along the three-fold axis. Near the top of the Apo-2L trimer interface in the vicinity of Cys230, the structures
 appear to diverge, and the conformation of the 190's and 230's loops are variable in each structure.</p><p> In contrast to the &lt;RTI ID=10.12&gt;beta-scaffold&lt;/RTI&gt;  core, the structure of the loops and receptor binding surfaces varies
 considerably among the TNF family members. One difference between the structure of Apo-2 ligand and the
 structures of TNF-alpha, TNF-beta, and CD40L is the connections between strands A and A'. &lt;RTI ID=10.13&gt;In TNF-alpha,&lt;/RTI&gt;  &lt;RTI ID=10.14&gt;TNF-beta,&lt;/RTI&gt;  and CD40L, strand A is followed by a compact loop. In Apo-2 ligand, a 15-residue insertion
 lengthens this loop and alters its conformation. The first part of the loop (residues &lt;RTI ID=10.15&gt;131&lt;/RTI&gt;  to 141) is disordered while the second part of the loop (residues 142 to 154) crosses the surface of the molecule from one monomermonomer interface to the next (see Figure 2A) with a conformation that resembles CD40L in its C-terminal portion.</p><p> Applicants surprisingly found a novel divalent metal ion (zinc) binding site buried near the top of the trimerization interface. The TNF family members can be divided by sequence analysis into three groups with respect to Cys230: &lt;RTI ID=10.16&gt;(1)&lt;/RTI&gt;  proteins such as TNF-alpha and Fas ligand in which a cysteine residue at the position corresponding to Cys230 is accompanied by another cysteine in the adjacent loop (the 194-203 loop in Apo-2L) with which it can form a disulfide bridge precluding it from interacting with a metal ion, (2) proteins without a cysteine corresponding to Cys230 (such as &lt;RTI ID=10.17&gt;TNF-beta&lt;/RTI&gt;  and OPGL), and (3) proteins which have only one cysteine residue corresponding to Cys230. Apo-2L and its orthologs in other species meet the latter criteria (i. e., proteins which have only Cys230) and are expected to bind divalent metal ions at the trimer surface. The conformation of the main chain immediately prior to Cys230 in Apo-2L differs from the disulfide containing TNF family members such as TNF-alpha and CD40L. In Apo-2L, the side chain of Cys230 is oriented towards the interface instead of away from it.</p><p> The Cys230 residue in each Apo-2L monomer point inward toward the trimer axis and coordinate a divalent metal ion in conjunction with an interior solvent molecule. This divalent metal ion binding site exhibits  
 slightly distorted tetrahedral geometry with bonds and angles appropriate for a zinc binding site and is
 completely inaccessible to solvent (see Figure 2B). The identity of the bound metal was confirmed using
 inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) (see Example 5). In a quantitative
 analysis for Cd, Co, Zn, Ni, and Cu using ICP-AES, 0.79 moles of Zn and 0.06 moles of Co per molecule of
 Apo-2L trimer were detected demonstrating that the bound ion in the structure was zinc at approximately a one
 to one molar ratio (see Example 5). The importance of this site was demonstrated by the observation that
 alanine substitution of Cys230 resulted in a  &gt; 8-fold decreased apoptotic activity (See Example 7). Furthermore,
 removal of the bound metal from Apo-2L by dialysis against chelating agents resulted in a 7-fold decrease in
 DR5 affinity and a  &gt; 90-fold decrease in apoptotic activity (see Example 6). Upon removal of the Zn, the
 cysteines became prone to oxidation and disulfide-linked Apo-2L dimers were formed which had decreased
 apoptotic activity. Since the metal binding site appears to be buried in the Apo-2L trimer structure and is not
 expected to contact receptor, the data suggests that divalent metal ion binding may be important to maintain the trimer structure and stability of Apo-2L.</p><p> In order to map Apo-2 ligand's receptor binding site, amino acid residues important for receptor binding and biological activity were identified by alanine-scanning mutagenesis. [<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Cunningham et &lt;RTI ID=11.1&gt;al.,&lt;/RTI&gt;  Science, 244: 1081-1085 (1989)</bibl>]. Single alanine substitutions at residues Argl49, &lt;RTI ID=11.2&gt;Gln205,&lt;/RTI&gt;  Val207, Tyr216, Glu236, or
Tyr237 resulted in a greater than 5-fold decrease in apoptotic activity in a bioassay and showed decreased affinity for the receptors (See Examples 3 and 4). Apo-2L binding to DR4, DR5 and DcR2 was most affected by alanine substitutions at residues &lt;RTI ID=11.3&gt;Gln205,&lt;/RTI&gt;  Tyr216, &lt;RTI ID=11.4&gt;Glu236,&lt;/RTI&gt;  or Tyr237, which resulted in at least a 5-fold decreased affinity against all three receptors. All of these variants with reduced apoptotic activity also exhibited impaired binding to either DR4 or DR5 (or both) suggesting that receptor binding is required for apoptotic activity.</p><p> Alanine substitutions at residues &lt;RTI ID=11.5&gt;Asp218&lt;/RTI&gt;  and Asp269 resulted in Apo-2L variants having increased apoptotic activity. (See Example 4). Residue &lt;RTI ID=11.6&gt;Asp218&lt;/RTI&gt;  is located near &lt;RTI ID=11.7&gt;Tyr216,&lt;/RTI&gt;  which is one of the required residues for apoptotic activity. A comparison to the low resolution Apo-2L structure (114-281 form) suggests that the conformation of the 216-220 loop does not appear to be significantly altered by the presence of the
D218A mutation.</p><p> When the results of the mutagenesis analysis were mapped to the Apo-2L trimer structure, the &lt;RTI ID=11.8&gt;functional&lt;/RTI&gt;  epitope on Apo-2L for receptor binding and biological activity was found to be located on the surface formed by the junction of two monomers (see Figure 5), similar to TNF-beta. A shallow groove at the monomer-monomer interface forms the receptor binding site with both monomers contributing to the binding site. Residues Arg32, Tyr87, and &lt;RTI ID=11.9&gt;Aspl43&lt;/RTI&gt;  in TNF-alpha (corresponding to Apo-2L residues &lt;RTI ID=11.10&gt;Argl58,&lt;/RTI&gt;  Tyr216, and Asp267) also make contributions to TNF receptor binding. [<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Goh et &lt;RTI ID=11.11&gt;al.,&lt;/RTI&gt;  Protein Engineering, &lt;RTI ID=11.12&gt;4:&lt;/RTI&gt;  785-791 (1991)</bibl>]. In contrast, residues of TNF-alpha (corresponding to residues &lt;RTI ID=11.13&gt;Gln205,&lt;/RTI&gt;  &lt;RTI ID=11.14&gt;Glu236,&lt;/RTI&gt;  and Tyr237 of Apo-2L) play only a minor role in TNFR binding. Thus, while for TNF-alpha the base of the trimer structure makes the most important contribution to receptor binding, in Apo-2L, important receptor binding residues are also presented on the top of the trimer structure. Apo-2L appears to be unique among the TNF family members of known structure in having a larger and more extended contact surface for interaction with its target receptors. It is believed that preferred Apo-2L variants will comprise native residues (i. e., will not be mutated) at positions corresponding to Argl49, &lt;RTI ID=11.15&gt;Gln205,&lt;/RTI&gt;  &lt;RTI ID=11.16&gt;Val207,&lt;/RTI&gt;  Tyr216, &lt;RTI ID=11.17&gt;Glu236,&lt;/RTI&gt;  and/or Tyr237.  </p><p> &lt;RTI ID=12.1&gt; ******************&lt;/RTI&gt; 
 The description below relates to methods of producing &lt;RTI ID=12.2&gt;Apo-2&lt;/RTI&gt;  ligand by culturing host cells transformed
 or transfected with a vector containing Apo-2 ligand encoding nucleic acid and recovering the polypeptide from
 the cell culture.</p><p> The DNA encoding Apo-2 ligand may be obtained from any &lt;RTI ID=12.3&gt;cDNA&lt;/RTI&gt;  library prepared from tissue
 believed to possess the Apo-2 ligand &lt;RTI ID=12.4&gt;mRNA&lt;/RTI&gt;  and to express it at a detectable level. Accordingly, human Apo-2
 ligand DNA can be conveniently obtained from a &lt;RTI ID=12.5&gt;cDNA&lt;/RTI&gt;  library prepared from human tissues, such as the
 bacteriophage library of human &lt;RTI ID=12.6&gt;placental cDNA&lt;/RTI&gt;  as described in <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">W097/25428</bibl>. The Apo-2 ligand-encoding gene
 may also be obtained from a genomic library or by oligonucleotide synthesis.</p><p> Libraries can be screened with probes (such as antibodies to the Apo-2 ligand or oligonucleotides of at
 least about 20-80 bases) designed to identify the gene of interest or the protein encoded by it. Screening the
 &lt;RTI ID=12.7&gt;cDNA&lt;/RTI&gt;  or genomic library with the selected probe may be conducted using standard procedures, such as described in <bibl type="book" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Sambrook et &lt;RTI ID=12.8&gt;al.,&lt;/RTI&gt;  Molecular Cloning: A Laboratorv Manual (New York: Cold Spring Harbor
 Laboratory Press, 1989</bibl>). An alternative means to isolate the gene encoding Apo-2 ligand is to use PCR methodology [Sambrook et &lt;RTI ID=12.9&gt;al.,&lt;/RTI&gt;  supra; <bibl type="book" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Dieffenbach et al., PCR Primer: A Laboratory Manual (Cold Spring
Harbor Laboratory Press, 1995)</bibl>].</p><p> Amino acid sequence fragments or variants of Apo-2 ligand can be prepared by introducing appropriate nucleotide changes into the Apo-2 ligand DNA, or by synthesis of the desired Apo-2 ligand polypeptide. Such fragments or variants represent insertions, substitutions, and/or deletions of residues within or at one or both of the ends of the intracellular region, the transmembrane region, or the extracellular region, or of the amino acid sequence shown for the &lt;RTI ID=12.10&gt;full-length&lt;/RTI&gt;  Apo-2 ligand in Figure 1 (SEQ ID &lt;RTI ID=12.11&gt;NO:&lt;/RTI&gt;  &lt;RTI ID=12.12&gt;1).&lt;/RTI&gt;  Any combination of insertion, substitution, and/or deletion can be made to arrive at the final construct, provided that the final construct possesses, for instance, a desired biological activity or apoptotic activity as defined herein. In a preferred embodiment, the fragments or variants have at least about 80% amino acid sequence identity, more preferably, at least about 90% sequence identity, and even more preferably, at least 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% or 99% sequence identity with the sequences identified herein for the intracellular, transmembrane, or extracellular domains of
Apo-2 ligand, or the full-length sequence for Apo-2 ligand. The amino acid changes also may alter posttranslational processes of the Apo-2 ligand, such as changing the number or position of &lt;RTI ID=12.13&gt;glycosylation&lt;/RTI&gt;  sites or altering the membrane anchoring characteristics.</p><p> Variations in the Apo-2 ligand sequence as described above can be made using any of the techniques and guidelines for conservative and non-conservative mutations set forth in <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">U. S. Pat. No. 5,364,934</bibl>. These include oligonucleotide-mediated (site-directed) mutagenesis, alanine scanning, and PCR mutagenesis.</p><p> Scanning amino acid analysis can be employed to identify one or more amino acids along a contiguous sequence. Among the preferred scanning amino acids are relatively small, neutral amino acids. Such amino acids include alanine, glycine, serine and cysteine. Alanine is typically a preferred scanning amino acid among this group because it eliminates the side-chain beyond the beta-carbon and is less likely to alter the main-chain conformation of the variant. [<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Cunningham et &lt;RTI ID=12.14&gt;al.,&lt;/RTI&gt;  Science, 244: 1081 (1989)</bibl>]. Alanine is also typically preferred because it is the most common amino acid. Further, it is frequently found in both buried and exposed positions [Creighton, The &lt;RTI ID=12.15&gt;Proteins,&lt;/RTI&gt;  (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">W. H.

 one or more of the recited alanine substitutions provided in TABLE I below. Such Apo-2L variants will
 typically comprise a non-naturally occurring amino acid sequence which differs from a native Apo-2L amino
 acid sequence (such as provided in Figure 1; SEQ ID NO: I, for a full length or mature form of Apo-2L or an
 extracellular domain sequence thereof) in at least one or more amino acids. Optionally, the one or more amino
 acids which differ in the Apo-2L variant as compared to a native Apo-2L will comprise amino acid
 substitution (s) such as those indicated in Table &lt;RTI ID=13.1&gt;I.&lt;/RTI&gt;  Apo-2L variants of the invention include soluble Apo-2L
 variants comprising residues 91-281,92-281,95-281 or 114-281 of Figure 1 (SEQ ID &lt;RTI ID=13.2&gt;NO:&lt;/RTI&gt;  &lt;RTI ID=13.3&gt;I)&lt;/RTI&gt;  and having one or
 more amino acid substitutions recited in TABLE &lt;RTI ID=13.4&gt;I.&lt;/RTI&gt;  Preferred Apo-2L variants will include those variants
 comprising residues 91-281,92-281,95-281 or &lt;RTI ID=13.5&gt;114-281&lt;/RTI&gt;  of Figure I (SEQ ID &lt;RTI ID=13.6&gt;NO:&lt;/RTI&gt;  &lt;RTI ID=13.7&gt;1)&lt;/RTI&gt;  and having one or more
 amino acid substitutions recited in TABLE I which enhance biological activity, such as receptor binding.</p><p> Variations in the Apo-2 ligand sequence also included within the scope of the invention relate to aminoterminal derivatives or modified forms. Such Apo-2 ligand sequences include any of the Apo-2 ligand
 polypeptides described herein having a methionine or modified methionine (such as formyl methionyl or other
 blocked &lt;RTI ID=13.8&gt;methionyl&lt;/RTI&gt;  species) at the N-terminus of the polypeptide sequence.</p><p> The nucleic acid (e. g., &lt;RTI ID=13.9&gt;cDNA&lt;/RTI&gt;  or genomic DNA) encoding native or variant Apo-2 ligand may be
 inserted into a replicable vector for further cloning (amplification of the DNA) or for expression. Various
 vectors are publicly available. The vector components generally include, but are not limited &lt;RTI ID=13.10&gt;to,&lt;/RTI&gt;  one or more of the following: a signal sequence, an origin of replication, one or more marker genes, an enhancer element, a promoter, and a transcription termination sequence, each of which is described below. Optional signal sequences, origins of replication, marker genes, enhancer elements and transcription terminator sequences that may be employed are known in the art and described in further detail in W097/25428.</p><p> Expression and cloning vectors usually contain a promoter that is recognized by the host organism and is operably linked to the Apo-2 ligand nucleic acid sequence. Promoters are untranslated sequences located upstream (5') to the start codon of a structural gene (generally within about 100 to 1000 bp) that control the transcription and translation of a particular nucleic acid sequence, such as the Apo-2 ligand nucleic acid sequence, to which they are operably linked. Such promoters typically fall into two classes, inducible and constitutive. Inducible promoters are promoters that initiate increased levels of transcription from DNA under their control in response to some change in culture conditions, e. g., the presence or absence of a nutrient or a change in temperature. At this time a large number of promoters recognized by a variety of potential host cells are well known. These promoters are operably linked to Apo-2 ligand encoding DNA by removing the promoter from the source DNA by restriction enzyme digestion and inserting the isolated promoter sequence into the vector. Both the native Apo-2 ligand promoter sequence and many heterologous promoters may be used to direct amplification and/or expression of the Apo-2 ligand DNA.</p><p> Promoters suitable for use with prokaryotic and eukaryotic hosts are known in the art, and are described in further detail in <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">W097/25428</bibl>.</p><p> A preferred method for the production of soluble Apo-2L in E. coli employs an inducible promoter for the regulation of product expression. The use of a controllable, inducible promoter allows for culture growth to the desirable cell density before induction of product expression and accumulation of significant amounts of product which may not be well tolerated by the host.  </p><p> Three inducible promoter systems (T7 polymerase, trp and alkaline phosphatase (AP)) have been
 evaluated by Applicants for the expression &lt;RTI ID=14.1&gt;ofApo-2L (form 114-281). The use&lt;/RTI&gt;  of each of these three promoters
 resulted in significant amounts of soluble, biologically active Apo-2L trimer being recovered from the harvested cell paste. The AP promoter is preferred among these three inducible promoter systems tested because of tighter
 promoter control and the higher cell density and titers reached in harvested cell paste.</p><p> Construction of suitable vectors containing one or more of the above-listed components employs
 standard ligation techniques. Isolated plasmids or DNA fragments are cleaved, tailored, and &lt;RTI ID=14.2&gt;re-ligated&lt;/RTI&gt;  in the
 form desired to generate the plasmids required.</p><p> For analysis to confirm correct sequences in plasmids constructed, the ligation mixtures can be used to &lt;RTI ID=14.3&gt;transform&lt;/RTI&gt;  E. coli K12 strain 294 (ATCC 31,446) and successful &lt;RTI ID=14.4&gt;transformants&lt;/RTI&gt;  selected by ampicillin or tetracycline resistance where appropriate. Plasmids from the transformants are prepared, analyzed by restriction endonuclease digestion, and/or sequenced using standard techniques known in the art.

In general, transient expression involves the use of an expression vector that is able to replicate efficiently in a host cell, such that the host cell accumulates many copies of the expression vector and, in turn, synthesizes high levels of a desired polypeptide encoded by the expression vector [Sambrook et al., supra]. Transient expression systems, comprising a suitable expression vector and a host cell, allow for the convenient positive identification of polypeptides encoded by cloned &lt;RTI ID=14.11&gt;DNAs,&lt;/RTI&gt;  as well as for the rapid screening of such polypeptides for desired biological or physiological properties.

Particular forms of culture media that may be employed for culturing E. coli are described further in the Examples below. Mammalian host cells used to produce Apo-2 ligand may be cultured in a variety of culture media.</p><p> Examples of commercially available culture media include &lt;RTI ID=15.6&gt;Ham's&lt;/RTI&gt;  F10 (Sigma), Minimal Essential

 included in the culture media for culturing or fermenting the host cells. The divalent metal ions are preferably
 present in or added to the culture media at a concentration level sufficient to enhance storage stability, enhance
 solubility, or assist in forming stable Apo-2L trimers coordinated by one or more zinc ions. The amount of
 divalent metal ions which may be added will be dependent, in part, on the host cell density in the culture or
 potential host cell sensitivity to such divalent metal ions. At higher host cell densities in the culture, it may be
 beneficial to increase the concentration of divalent metal ions. If the divalent metal ions are added during or
 after product expression by the host cells, it may be desirable to adjust or increase the divalent metal ion
 concentration as product expression by the host cells increases. It is generally believed that trace levels of
 divalent metal ions which may be present in typical commonly available cell culture media may not be sufficient
 for stable trimer formation. Thus, addition of further quantities of divalent metal ions, as described herein, is
 preferred.</p><p> The divalent metal ions are preferably added to the culture media at a concentration which does not
 adversely or negatively affect host cell growth, if the divalent metal ions are being added during the growth
 phase of the host cells in the culture. In shake flask cultures, it was observed that &lt;RTI ID=16.1&gt;ZnS04&lt;/RTI&gt;  added at
 concentrations of greater than I mM can result in lower host cell density. Those skilled in the art appreciate that
 bacterial cells can sequester metal ions effectively by forming metal ion complexes with cellular matrices. Thus,
 in the cell cultures, it is preferable to add the selected divalent metal ions to the culture media after the growth phase (after the desired host cell density is achieved) or just prior to product expression by the host cells. To ensure that sufficient amounts of divalent metal ions are present, additional divalent metal ions may be added or fed to the cell culture media during the product expression phase.</p><p> The divalent metal ion concentration in the culture media should not exceed the concentration which may be detrimental or toxic to the host cells. In the methods of the invention employing the host cell, E. coli, it
 is preferred that the concentration of the divalent metal ion concentration in the culture media does not exceed about &lt;RTI ID=16.2&gt;ImM&lt;/RTI&gt;  (preferably,  &lt;  &lt;RTI ID=16.3&gt;ImM).&lt;/RTI&gt;  Even more preferably, the divalent metal ion concentration in the culture media is about 50 micromolar to about 250 micromolar. Most preferably, the divalent metal ion used in such methods is zinc sulfate. It is desirable to add the divalent metal ions to the cell culture in an amount wherein the metal ions and Apo-2 ligand trimer can be present at a one to one molar ratio.</p><p> The divalent metal ions can be added to the cell culture in any acceptable form. For instance, a solution of the metal ion can be made using water, and the divalent metal ion solution can then be added or fed to the culture media.</p><p> In one embodiment of the invention, the selected Apo-2L (form 114-281) is expressed in E. coli, and during the culturing or fermentation of the cell culture, the process parameters are set such that cellular activities are conducted at oxygen uptake rates of approximately 1.0 to 3.0 mmoles/L-min for cultures at approximately 40-50 gm/L dry cell weight. It is preferred that the newly synthesized nascent Apo-2L polypeptides have sufficient time for proper protein folding and trimerization of Apo-2L monomers. The growth phase of the fermentation process is preferably conducted at &lt;RTI ID=16.4&gt;30 C.&lt;/RTI&gt;  Just prior to the commencement of product expression, the process temperature control set-point may remain at &lt;RTI ID=16.5&gt;30 C&lt;/RTI&gt;  or be down-shifted to &lt;RTI ID=16.6&gt;25 C&lt;/RTI&gt;  for the rest of the fermentation. Optionally, it may be desired to increase cell density in the cell culture, and the above-mentioned parameters may be adjusted (or increased) accordingly. For instance, it may be advantageous to increase cell  
 density in the cell culture to increase volumetric yield. One skilled in the art can, by using routine techniques
 known in the art, incrementally increase the cell density and incrementally increase the above-mentioned
 parameters, if desired.</p><p> Expression of the Apo-2L may be measured in a sample directly, for example, by conventional
 Southern blotting, Northern blotting to quantitate the transcription of &lt;RTI ID=17.1&gt;mRNA&lt;/RTI&gt;  [<bibl next="bibl10" type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Thomas, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.</bibl></p><p><bibl xml:id="bibl10" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"> USA, 77: 5201-5205 (1980)</bibl>], dot blotting (DNA analysis), or in situ hybridization, using an appropriately
 labeled probe, based on the sequences provided herein. Various labels may be employed, most commonly
 radioisotopes, and particularly 32P. However, other techniques may also be employed, such as using biotin
 modified &lt;RTI ID=17.2&gt;nucleotides&lt;/RTI&gt;  for introduction into a polynucleotide. The biotin then serves as the site for binding to
 avidin or antibodies, which may be labeled with a wide variety of labels, such as radionucleotides, fluorescers or
 enzymes. &lt;RTI ID=17.3&gt;Alternatively,&lt;/RTI&gt;  antibodies may be employed that can recognize specific duplexes, including DNA
 duplexes, RNA duplexes, and DNA-RNA hybrid duplexes or DNA-protein duplexes. The antibodies in turn
 may be labeled and the assay may be carried out where the duplex is bound to a surface, so that upon the
 formation of duplex on the surface, the presence of antibody bound to the duplex can be detected.</p><p> Gene expression, alternatively, may be measured by immunological methods, such as
 immunohistochemical staining of cells or tissue sections and assay of cell culture or body fluids, to quantitate directly the expression of gene product. With immunohistochemical staining techniques, a cell sample is prepared, typically by dehydration and fixation, followed by reaction with labeled antibodies specific for the gene product coupled, where the labels are usually visually detectable, such as enzymatic labels, fluorescent labels, luminescent labels, and the like.</p><p> Antibodies useful for immunohistochemical staining and/or assay of sample fluids may be either monoclonal or polyclonal, and may be prepared in any mammal. Conveniently, the antibodies may be prepared against a native Apo-2 ligand polypeptide or against a synthetic peptide based on the DNA sequences provided herein or against exogenous sequence fused to Apo-2 ligand DNA and encoding a specific antibody epitope.</p><p> Apo-2 ligand preferably is recovered from the culture medium as a secreted polypeptide, although it also may be recovered from host cell lysates when directly produced without a secretory signal. If the Apo-2 ligand is membrane-bound, it can be released from the membrane using a suitable detergent solution (e. g.</p><p>Triton-X 100) or its extracellular region may be released by enzymatic cleavage.</p><p> When Apo-2 ligand is produced in a recombinant cell other than one of human origin, the Apo-2 ligand is free of proteins or polypeptides of human origin. However, it is usually necessary to recover or purify Apo-2 ligand from recombinant cell proteins or polypeptides to obtain preparations that are substantially homogeneous as to Apo-2 ligand. As a first step, the culture medium or lysate may be centrifuged to remove particulate cell debris. Apo-2 ligand thereafter is purified from contaminant soluble proteins and polypeptides, with the following procedures being exemplary of suitable purification procedures: by fractionation on an ion-exchange column; ethanol precipitation; reverse phase HPLC; chromatography on silica or on a cation-exchange resin such as DEAE or CM; chromatofocusing; SDS-PAGE; ammonium sulfate precipitation; gel filtration using, for example, Sephadex G-75; diafiltration and protein A Sepharose columns to remove contaminants such as IgG.</p><p>In a preferred embodiment, the Apo-2 ligand can be isolated by affinity chromatography. Apo-2 ligand fragments or variants in which residues have been deleted, inserted, or substituted are recovered in the same fashion as native Apo-2 ligand, taking account of any substantial changes in properties occasioned by the  
 variation. For example, preparation of an Apo-2 ligand fusion with another protein or polypeptide, e. g., a
 bacterial or viral antigen, facilitates purification; an immunoaffinity column containing antibody to the antigen
 can be used to adsorb the fusion polypeptide.</p><p> A protease inhibitor such as &lt;RTI ID=18.1&gt;phenyl&lt;/RTI&gt;  methyl sulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) also may be useful to inhibit
 proteolytic degradation during purification, and antibiotics may be included to prevent the growth of
 adventitious contaminants. One skilled in the art will appreciate that purification methods suitable for native
 Apo-2 ligand may require modification to account for changes in the character of Apo-2 ligand or its variants
 upon expression in recombinant cell culture.</p><p> During any such purification steps, it may be desirable to expose the recovered Apo-2L to a divalent
 metal ion-containing solution or to purification material (such as a chromatography medium or support)
 containing one or more divalent metal ions. In a preferred embodiment, the divalent metal ions and/or reducing
 agent is used during recovery or purification of the Apo-2L. Optionally, both divalent metal ions and reducing
 agent, such as DTT or BME, may be used during recovery or purification of the Apo-2L. It is believed that use
 of divalent metal ions during recovery or purification will provide for stability of Apo-2L trimer or preserve
 Apo-2L trimer formed during the cell culturing step.</p><p> A preferred method of recovering and purifying the expressed Apo-2L from prokaryotic host cells
 (most preferably from bacterial host cells) comprises the following steps: (a) extracting Apo-2L (intracellular)
 from E. coli cells; (b) stabilizing the properly folded Apo-2L in a buffer solution comprising divalent metal ions
 and/or reducing agent; (c) purifying the Apo-2L by chromatography using, sequentially, a cationic exchanger, a hydroxyapatite and a hydrophobic interaction chromatograph, and (d) selectively &lt;RTI ID=18.2&gt;eluting&lt;/RTI&gt;  Apo-2L in a buffer solution comprising divalent metal ions and/or reducing agent from each such chromatographic support. The divalent metal ions and the reducing agent utilized in such methods may include a Zn sulfate, Zn chloride, Co sulfate, DTT and BME, and more preferably, a Zn sulfate or DTT. An even more detailed description of this recovery and purification process is provided in Example 8 below.</p><p> As discussed above, such methods of the invention are applicable and useful for various other proteins, besides Apo-2L, which have improved activity when in a trimerized form or which require trimerization of the protein for activity.</p><p> &lt;RTI ID=18.3&gt; ************************&lt;/RTI&gt; 
 Formulations comprising Apo-2 ligand and one or more divalent metal ions are also provided by the present invention. It is believed that such formulations will be particularly suitable for storage (and maintain
Apo-2L trimerization), as well as for therapeutic administration. Preferred formulations will comprise Apo-2L and zinc or cobalt. More preferably, the formulation will comprise an Apo-2L and zinc or cobalt solution in which the metal is at a  &lt; 2X molar ratio to the protein. If an aqueous suspension is desired, the divalent metal ion in the formulation may be at a  &gt; 2X molar ratio to the protein. Using zinc sulfate, Applicants have found
Apo-2L (form 114-281) precipitates and forms an aqueous suspension at about a &lt;RTI ID=18.4&gt;100mM&lt;/RTI&gt;  concentration of zinc sulfate in the formulation. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that at a  &gt; 2X molar ratio, there may be an upper range of concentration of the divalent metal ion in the formulation at which the metal can become deleterious to the formulation or would be undesirable as a therapeutic formulation.</p><p> The formulations may be prepared by known techniques. For instance, the Apo-2L formulation may be prepared by buffer exchange on a gel filtration column  
 Typically, an appropriate amount of a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt is used in the formulation to
 render the formulation isotonic. Examples of pharmaceutically-acceptable carriers include saline, Ringer's
 solution and dextrose solution. The pH of the formulation is preferably from about 6 to about 9, and more
 preferably from about 7 to about 7.5. Preferably, the pH is selected so as to ensure that the zinc remains bound to the Apo-2L. If the pH is too high or too low, the zinc does not remain bound to the Apo-2L and as a result,
 dimers of Apo-2L will tend to form. It will be apparent to those persons skilled in the art that certain carriers
 may be more preferable depending upon, for instance, the route of administration and concentrations of Apo-2
 ligand and divalent metal ions.</p><p> Therapeutic compositions of the Apo-2L can be prepared by mixing the desired Apo-2L molecule having the appropriate degree of purity with optional pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, excipients, or
 stabilizers (<bibl type="book" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 16th edition, Oslo, A. ed. (1980)</bibl>), in the form of lyophilized
 formulations, aqueous solutions or aqueous suspensions. Acceptable carriers, excipients, or stabilizers are preferably nontoxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed, and include buffers such as Tris,
HEPES, PIPES, phosphate, citrate, and other organic acids; antioxidants including ascorbic acid and methionine; preservatives (such as &lt;RTI ID=19.1&gt;octadecyldimethylbenzyl&lt;/RTI&gt;  ammonium chloride; hexamethonium chloride; benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride; phenol, butyl or benzyl &lt;RTI ID=19.2&gt;alcohol;&lt;/RTI&gt;  alkyl parabens such as methyl or propyl paraben; catechol; resorcinol; cyclohexanol; &lt;RTI ID=19.3&gt;3-pentanol;&lt;/RTI&gt;  and m-cresol); low molecular weight (less than about 10 residues) polypeptides; proteins, such as serum &lt;RTI ID=19.4&gt;albumin,&lt;/RTI&gt;  gelatin, or &lt;RTI ID=19.5&gt;immunoglobulins ;&lt;/RTI&gt;  hydrophilic polymers such as &lt;RTI ID=19.6&gt;polyvinylpyrrolidone;&lt;/RTI&gt;  amino acids such as glycine, glutamine, asparagine, histidine, arginine, or lysine; monosaccharides, disaccharides, and other carbohydrates including glucose, mannose, or dextrins; sugars such as sucrose, mannitol, trehalose or sorbitol; salt-forming counter-ions such as sodium; and/or nonionic surfactants such as &lt;RTI ID=19.7&gt;TWEEN, PLURONICS or&lt;/RTI&gt;  polyethylene glycol (PEG).</p><p> Additional examples of such carriers include ion &lt;RTI ID=19.8&gt;exchangers,&lt;/RTI&gt;  alumina, aluminum stearate, lecithin, serum proteins, such as human serum albumin, buffer substances such as glycine, sorbic acid, potassium sorbate, partial glyceride mixtures of saturated vegetable fatty acids, water, salts, or electrolytes such as protamine sulfate, disodium hydrogen phosphate, potassium hydrogen phosphate, sodium chloride, colloidal silica, magnesium trisilicate, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, and cellulose-based substances. Carriers for topical or gel-based forms include polysaccharides such as sodium &lt;RTI ID=19.9&gt;carboxymethylcellulose&lt;/RTI&gt;  or methylcellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyacrylates, polyoxyethylene-polyoxypropylene-block polymers, polyethylene glycol, and wood wax alcohols.</p><p>For all administrations, conventional depot forms are suitably used. Such forms include, for example, microcapsules, nano-capsules, liposomes, plasters, inhalation forms, nose sprays, sublingual tablets, and sustained-release preparations.</p><p> Effective dosages of Apo-2 ligand in the formulations may be determined empirically, and making such determinations is within the skill in the art. It is presently believed that an effective dosage or amount of Apo-2 ligand may range from about I &lt;RTI ID=19.10&gt;microgram/kg&lt;/RTI&gt;  to about 100 mg/kg of body weight or more per day. &lt;RTI ID=19.11&gt;Interspecies&lt;/RTI&gt;  scaling of dosages can be performed in a manner known in the art, e. g., as disclosed in <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Mordenti et al.,
Pharmaceut. &lt;RTI ID=19.12&gt;Res.,&lt;/RTI&gt;  &lt;RTI ID=19.13&gt;8:&lt;/RTI&gt;  1351 (1991)</bibl>. Those skilled in the art will understand that the dosage of Apo-2 ligand that must be administered will vary depending on, for example, the mammal which will receive the Apo-2 ligand, the route of administration, and other drugs or therapies being administered to the mammal.  </p><p> Apo-2L to be used for in vivo administration should be sterile. This is readily accomplished by
 filtration through sterile filtration membranes, prior to or following &lt;RTI ID=20.1&gt;lyophilization&lt;/RTI&gt;  and reconstitution. Apo-2L
 ordinarily will be stored in &lt;RTI ID=20.2&gt;lyophilized&lt;/RTI&gt;  form or in solution if administered systemically. If in &lt;RTI ID=20.3&gt;lyophilized&lt;/RTI&gt;  form,
 Apo-2L is typically formulated in combination with other ingredients for reconstitution with an appropriate
 diluent at the time for use. An example of a liquid formulation of Apo-2L is a sterile, clear, colorless
 unpreserved solution filled in a single-dose vial for subcutaneous injection.</p><p> Therapeutic Apo-2L formulations generally are placed into a container having a sterile access port, for example, an intravenous solution bag or vial having a stopper pierceable by a hypodermic injection needle. The
 formulations are preferably administered as repeated intravenous (i. v.), subcutaneous (s. c.), intramuscular (i. m.)
 injections or infusions, or as aerosol formulations suitable for &lt;RTI ID=20.4&gt;intranasal&lt;/RTI&gt;  or intrapulmonary delivery (for
 intrapulmonary delivery see, e. g., <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">EP 257,956</bibl>).</p><p> Apo-2L can also be administered in the form of sustained-release preparations. Suitable examples of sustained-release preparations include &lt;RTI ID=20.5&gt;semipermeable&lt;/RTI&gt;  matrices of solid hydrophobic polymers containing the protein, which matrices are in the form of shaped articles, e. g., films, or &lt;RTI ID=20.6&gt;microcapsules.&lt;/RTI&gt;  Examples of sustainedrelease matrices include polyesters, hydrogels (e. g., &lt;RTI ID=20.7&gt;poly (2-hydroxyethyl-methacrylate)&lt;/RTI&gt;  as described by <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Langer et aL, J.

It is believed that a chlorine molecule on the trimer axis is present as the fourth ligand to the zinc. The final model consists of residues 120130,142-194,203-281 with 170 solvent molecules and one zinc ion and one chloride ion. Residues 91-119, 131-141, and 195-202 are disordered.

Determination of receptor binding affinity of Apo-2L Variants
 Dissociation constants (Kd) for binding of Apo-2L variants (see Table &lt;RTI ID=23.22&gt;I)&lt;/RTI&gt;  to immobilized receptor immunoadhesins were determined from surface plasmon resonance (SPR) measurements on a Pharmacia &lt;RTI ID=23.23&gt;BIAcore&lt;/RTI&gt;  1000.</p><p> &lt;RTI ID=23.24&gt;DR5-IgG&lt;/RTI&gt;  (also referred to as &lt;RTI ID=23.25&gt;Apo-2-IgG)&lt;/RTI&gt;  and DcR2-IgG receptor immunoadhesins were prepared as described in &lt;RTI ID=23.26&gt;W098/51793&lt;/RTI&gt;  published November 19,1998 and &lt;RTI ID=23.27&gt;W099/10484&lt;/RTI&gt;  published March 9,1999, respectively. &lt;RTI ID=23.28&gt;DR4-lgG&lt;/RTI&gt;  was prepared as follows.

Apoptotic activity of Apo-2L Variants in vitro
 A bioassay which measures cell viability from the metabolic conversion of a fluorescent dye was used to determine the apoptotic activity of Apo-2L variants. Serial 2-fold dilutions of Apo-2L (form 114-281) or
Apo-2L variants (see Table I) were made in &lt;RTI ID=24.7&gt;RPMI-1640&lt;/RTI&gt;  media (Gibco) containing 0.1% BSA, and 50 uL of each dilution was transferred to individual wells of 96-well Falcon tissue culture &lt;RTI ID=24.8&gt;microplates.&lt;/RTI&gt;  50 &lt;RTI ID=24.9&gt;uL&lt;/RTI&gt;  of SK&lt;RTI ID=24.10&gt;MES-1&lt;/RTI&gt;  human lung carcinoma cells (ATCC &lt;RTI ID=24.11&gt;HTB58)&lt;/RTI&gt;  (in &lt;RTI ID=24.12&gt;RMPI-1640,0.1&lt;/RTI&gt;  % BSA) were added at a density of 2 x 104 cells/well. These mixtures were incubated at &lt;RTI ID=24.13&gt;37  C&lt;/RTI&gt;  for 24 hours. At 20 hours, 25 uL of alamar Blue (AccuMed, Inc., Westlake, Ohio) was added. Cell number was determined by measuring the relative fluorescence at 590 nm upon excitation at 530 nm. These data were analyzed by using a 4 parameter fit to calculate &lt;RTI ID=24.14&gt;EDo,&lt;/RTI&gt;  the concentration of Apo-2L giving a 50% reduction in cell viability.</p><p> Single alanine substitutions at residues &lt;RTI ID=24.15&gt;Argl49, Gln205, Val207, Tyr216, Glu236&lt;/RTI&gt;  or Tyr237 resulted in a greater than 5-fold decrease in apoptotic activity in the bioassay and showed decreased affinity for DR4, DR5 and DcR2 (Table &lt;RTI ID=24.16&gt;1).&lt;/RTI&gt;  Apo-2L binding to these receptors was most affected by alanine substitution of &lt;RTI ID=24.17&gt;Gln205,&lt;/RTI&gt; 
Tyr216, &lt;RTI ID=24.18&gt;Glu236&lt;/RTI&gt;  and Tyr237, all of which resulted in at least a 5-fold decreased affinity for all three receptors.</p><p>All of the Apo-2L variants with reduced apoptotic activity also exhibited impaired binding to either DR4 or DR5 (or both) suggesting that receptor-binding is required for the biological effect. Alanine substitution &lt;RTI ID=24.19&gt;of Asp218&lt;/RTI&gt;  or Asp269 resulted in a greater than 2-fold increase in apoptotic activity. It is noteworthy that most alanine substitutions have similar effects on both DR4 and DR5 binding, the only exceptions being mutation of &lt;RTI ID=24.20&gt;Glnl93,&lt;/RTI&gt;  &lt;RTI ID=24.21&gt;Glu195,&lt;/RTI&gt;  Ser259, His264, and Asp267, all of which had a greater than 5-fold effect on DR4 binding (decreasing affinity) but only a small or negligible effect on DR5 binding. Changes in DcR2-binding tended to parallel the effects observed for DR4-binding. &lt;RTI ID=24.22&gt;Diminished&lt;/RTI&gt;  apoptotic activity appears to be most closely linked with decreased &lt;RTI ID=24.23&gt;DR5-binding&lt;/RTI&gt;  suggesting that DR5 is required for death signaling in SK-MES in response to Apo-2L administration.</p><p> EXAMPLE 5
 Elemental and Quantitative Analysis to Determine Metal Content &lt;RTI ID=24.24&gt;of Apo-2L&lt;/RTI&gt; 
 Elemental analysis of Apo-2L was performed by using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES). For this determination, a 2 &lt;RTI ID=24.25&gt;mg/mL&lt;/RTI&gt;  solution of Apo-2L (residues 114-281 produced in
E. coli using methods disclosed in W097/25428; additional quantities of divalent metal ions were not added  during fermentation or purification in accordance with the methods described herein) formulated in 20 mM Tris pH 7.5 was used. Levels of Cd, Co, Zn, Ni, and Cu in this sample and in a portion of the formulation buffer were determined.</p><p> TABLE 11.</p><p> Sample Cd Co Zn Ni Cu

 The metals bound to the Apo-2L were Zn and Co (Table &lt;RTI ID=25.1&gt;11).&lt;/RTI&gt;  The calculated molar ratios were 0.79 moles of Zn per mole of Apo-2L trimer and 0.06 moles of Co per mole of Apo-2L trimer. These data indicate
Apo-2L has one zinc binding site per trimer. The site is 85% occupied with metal in this preparation of Apo-2L.</p><p> EXAMPLE 6
Effects of Removal of Bound Zinc from Apo-2L Using &lt;RTI ID=25.2&gt;Chelating&lt;/RTI&gt;  Agents
 A sample of Apo-2L (form 114-281) was treated with chelating agents to remove the bound zinc. The sample was first dialyzed against 2 changes of 1000 volumes each of 50 mM EDTA, then against 2 changes of 1000 volumes of 2 mM &lt;RTI ID=25.3&gt;1,10-phenanthroline,&lt;/RTI&gt;  and finally against 1000 volumes of metal-free 20 mM Tris pH 7.5.</p><p>The sample, before and after the chelating treatment, was assayed for receptor-binding, metal content and apoptotic activity. Receptor binding was measured as described in Example 3, metal content was determined by
ICP-AES and apoptotic activity was assayed as described in Example 4. ICP-AES showed that the dialysis procedure removed the bound zinc. After this treatment, the receptor affinity was significantly reduced (Table I) and the apoptotic activity was decreased 90-fold (Figure 4).</p><p> Circular dichroic spectra were recorded on an AVIV instrument (Lakewood, NJ) model 202 spectropolarimeter. The spectrum was scanned from 250 to 200 nm using a step size of 0.5 nm, an averaging time of 5 seconds, and quartz rectangular cuvettes having a &lt;RTI ID=25.4&gt;pathlength&lt;/RTI&gt;  of 1 cm. The protein concentration was 2 &lt;RTI ID=25.5&gt;uM&lt;/RTI&gt;  in solutions containing PBS. As shown in Figure 6, Apo-2L (form 114-281) gives a CD &lt;RTI ID=25.6&gt;spectrum&lt;/RTI&gt;  typical of a protein having a high beta-sheet content. Removal of the bound zinc results in a decreased intensity of the dichroic peaks suggesting that the beta-sheet content has been diminished.</p><p> Circular dichroism was used to monitor the effect of zinc removal on the thermal stability of Apo-2L (form 114-281). These experiments also used I cm quartz rectangular cuvettes and a protein concentration of 2 &lt;RTI ID=25.7&gt;pM.&lt;/RTI&gt;  Circular dichroism at 225 nm was monitored as the sample was heated from 30 to &lt;RTI ID=25.8&gt;100  C.&lt;/RTI&gt;  Measurements were taken at &lt;RTI ID=25.9&gt;2  C&lt;/RTI&gt;  increments after allowing the sample to equilibrate at that temperature for 1 minute. Both the ellipticity (CD) and dynode voltage were recorded and the temperature dependence of the dynode voltage is plotted in Figure 7. The dynode voltage is proportional to the absorbance of the sample. An increase in dynode voltage upon heating of the sample reflects protein aggregation. The increase in dynode voltage was concomitant with a loss of secondary structure as indicated by a decrease in the ellipticity at 225 &lt;RTI ID=25.10&gt;nm.&lt;/RTI&gt;  These data suggest that Apo-2L (form 114-281) aggregates upon thermal denaturation with the midpoint for this transition (Tm) occurring at about 75 &lt;RTI ID=25.11&gt; C.&lt;/RTI&gt;  Removal of the bound zinc results in a large decrease in the Tm for thermal  denaturation to about &lt;RTI ID=26.1&gt;54  C.&lt;/RTI&gt;  These data show that the bound zinc is necessary for maintenance of the structure and stability of homotrimeric Apo-2L.</p><p> EXAMPLE 7
Effects &lt;RTI ID=26.2&gt;of Removal&lt;/RTI&gt;  of Zinc Binding Site from Apo-2L bv Mutation
 Cys230 of Apo-2L (form 91-281) was replaced with Ala or Ser by using &lt;RTI ID=26.3&gt;oligonucleotide-directed&lt;/RTI&gt;  mutagenesis as described in Example 1. The variant proteins were then expressed and purified as described in
Example 1. As shown in Table 1, both the C230A and C230S mutants of Apo-2L (form 91-281) had reduced receptor-binding affinity and greatly diminished apoptotic activity. Since the Apo-2L x-ray structure shows that
Cys230 is a buried residue, and thus is &lt;RTI ID=26.4&gt;unlikely&lt;/RTI&gt;  to directly contact receptor upon &lt;RTI ID=26.5&gt;complex&lt;/RTI&gt;  formation, these data suggest that mutation of Cys230 &lt;RTI ID=26.6&gt;indirectly&lt;/RTI&gt;  affects activity by changes in the structure or stability of homotrimeric Apo-2L.</p><p> EXAMPLE 8

After the initial flow-through and wash steps, two main peaks, Peak
A and Peak B, were resolved.

The ratio of Peak A to Peak B was estimated by weighing the cut out traces representing the integrated area under each of the peaks. Results tabulated in Table V show a shift of the percent of Apo-2L as  
 Peak A from approximately 45% on the average for the minus-ZnS04 case to approximately 80% for the plus

 The following protocol may be employed in recovery and purification of Apo-2L from E. &lt;RTI ID=30.5&gt;coli.&lt;/RTI&gt;  First,
 the cells are homogenized and extraction is performed as follows. Frozen harvested Escherichia coli cells are
 suspended in 6 volumes of extraction buffer (100 mM HEPES/5 mM DTT (or 5 mM Zn sulfate instead of DTT),
 pH 8.0), or whole cell broth is conditioned with 5 mM DTT (or 5 mM Zn sulfate instead of DTT) &lt;RTI ID=30.6&gt;&amp;commat;&lt;/RTI&gt;  pH 8.0.</p><p> The suspension is thoroughly mixed for 1 hour at &lt;RTI ID=30.7&gt;2-8  C,&lt;/RTI&gt;  then homogenized in a homogenizer (Gaulin
 Corporation, Everett, MA). The broken cell suspension is flocculated in 0.2 % PEI for &lt;RTI ID=30.8&gt;1-2&lt;/RTI&gt;  hours and
 centrifuged by a BTPX205 (Alfa Laval Separation AB, Sweden) continuous feed centrifuge and clarified by
 depth filtration.</p><p>  After extraction, the Apo-2L is purified as follows. Macro-Prep ceramic High S (MP-HS) chromatography is performed by conditioning the clarified cell suspension (extract) with an equal volume of
 &lt;RTI ID=30.9&gt;H20/0.1% Triton-100&lt;/RTI&gt;  and adjusted pH to 7.2. The conditioned extract is loaded onto a column of MP-HS cation exchanger (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) that is equilibrated in 50 mM HEPES/0.05% Triton-100/1 mM DTT (or &lt;RTI ID=30.10&gt;100&lt;/RTI&gt;  uM Zn sulfate), pH 7.2.

 The same production organism, medium composition, fermentation conditions and sample analysis described in Example 8A were used in studying the effect of additions of metal ion other than Zn, namely cobalt chloride, on Apo-2L (amino acid residues 114-281) product accumulation. A solution of 100 mM &lt;RTI ID=31.3&gt;CoCl2&lt;/RTI&gt;  in &lt;RTI ID=31.4&gt;H2O&lt;/RTI&gt;  was used in place of the 100 mM &lt;RTI ID=31.5&gt;ZnS04&lt;/RTI&gt;  and sufficient amounts were added to arrive at a final concentration of 50-100 &lt;RTI ID=31.6&gt;vM&lt;/RTI&gt;  at each of the two additions.</p><p> Figure &lt;RTI ID=31.7&gt;11&lt;/RTI&gt;  shows the benefits of additions of &lt;RTI ID=31.8&gt;Cocu2&lt;/RTI&gt;  on soluble Apo-2L accumulation during the fermentation process. Like the &lt;RTI ID=31.9&gt;ZnS04&lt;/RTI&gt;  addition experiments, though not as significant, a higher accumulation rate of soluble Apo-2L product was detected by the IEX HPLC assay method. The data demonstrates that additions of certain metal ions generally improve soluble Apo-2L accumulation, likely as a result of their ability to stabilize the assembled trimers of Apo-2L.</p><p> EXAMPLE 10

Effects of Zinc Metal Ions on Apo-2 Ligand Formulation &lt;RTI ID=32.2&gt;Stability&lt;/RTI&gt; 
 As indicated in Example 8B, the first step in the purification process using MPHS cation exchanger gives two peaks, A and B. To investigate the storage stability of the two peaks, Apo-2L (form 114-281) was extracted from the E. coli expressed product (using the pS 1346. ApoL. O plasmid with trp promoter), and purified by MPHS cation exchanger. The MPHS Peak A was further purified by MP-Hydroxyapatite and Phenyl
Sepharose FF, and then formulated using G-25 gel filtration. The MPHS Peak B was purified by MP
Hydroxyapatite, &lt;RTI ID=32.3&gt;Phenyl-Sepharose&lt;/RTI&gt;  FF, and &lt;RTI ID=32.4&gt;Ni-NTA&lt;/RTI&gt;  Superflow and then formulated on G-25 gel filtration into 20 mM Tris, 8% &lt;RTI ID=32.5&gt;trehalose,&lt;/RTI&gt;  0.01% Tween 20, pH 7.5. The samples were sterile &lt;RTI ID=32.6&gt;filled&lt;/RTI&gt;  into 3cc glass vials and sealed with teflon coated greybutyl stoppers. The storage stability of the purified and formulated Peaks A and B were evaluated at the time (weeks ("wk") or months ("mo")) and temperatures &lt;RTI ID=32.7&gt;( C)&lt;/RTI&gt;  listed in Table VIII.  </p><p>TABLE &lt;RTI ID=33.1&gt;VIII.&lt;/RTI&gt;

 Table VIII shows, among other things, the percent monomer (% M) and percent dimer (% D);"ND" refers to those values not determined. Peak A included slightly less dimer and other impurities than Peak B at
Day 0. As shown in Table VIII, Peak B was found to be more thermally labile, as assessed by the more extensive precipitation at &lt;RTI ID=33.2&gt;30  C&lt;/RTI&gt;  (approximately 40% more at the 2 month point). Even at &lt;RTI ID=33.3&gt;5  C,&lt;/RTI&gt;  Peak B was approximately 2-fold more prone to dimer formation than Peak A. Biochemical analysis of Peaks A and B indicated that the material of each was biochemically equivalent except for their respective stability properties.</p><p>It is believed that the lower stability of Peak B may be related to improper (trimer) assembly or lower zinc content (0.83 molar ratio of Zinc to protein for Peak A and 0.7 molar ratio of Zinc to protein for Peak B).
