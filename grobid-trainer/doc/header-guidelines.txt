Set of files:
------------

After running Grobid on a set of PDF files using methods for creating training data, each article comes with at least:
- the PDF used to generate the training data, for instance toto.pdf
- a pre-annotated file for the header segments: toto.header.tei.xml
- the list of tokens considered for the header and the associated features: toto.header - this file can be ignored to a large extend

In addition, depending on the metadata available in the article's header, the following files have also been produced:
- a pre-annotated file for the detailed affiliation and address recognition: toto.affiliation.tei.xml
- a pre-annotated file for the detailed authors recognition: toto.authors.tei.xml
- a pre-annotated file for the detailed reference segment analysis: toto.header-references.xml
- a pre-annotated file for the detailed date analysis: toto.date.xml

Annotations
-----------

Example of existing annotations can be found under examples_annotations.

* For the affiliation+address annotations, see the file guidelines-affiliation_address.pdf
Affiliation markers are annotated with the tag <marker>
Additional text/characters that do not belong to one of the standard elements (<orgName>, <addrLine>, <settlement>, <region>, <postCode>, <country>, <postBox>, <marker>) can be left untagged out of these elements, within the <author> block.

* for dates, we do not follow the TEI but a basic XML format based on <day>, <month> and <year> elements. Additional text/characters that do not belong to one of these elements can be left untagged within the <date> elements.

* for names, we use relatively standard tags (<forename>, <middlename>, <surname>, <roleName>, <suffix>). Additional text/characters that do not belong to one of these elements can be left untagged within the <author> elements

* for references, we use the following tags:
- <author> for the complete sequence of authors
- <title> for article title
- <journal> for journal title
- <booktitle> for non journal bibliographical item holding the cited article. Note if a book is cited, the title of the book is annotated with <booktitle>. If a thesis is cited, the title of the thesis is annotated ith <title>, and the type of thesis by <tech>
- <date> the date sequence (including parenthesis, etc.)
- <pages> the full range of pages
- <volume> the block for volume (e.g. <volume> vol. 7,</volume>)
- <issue> the block for the issue (e.g. <issue>no. 3, </issue>)
- <tech> the king of technical report/thesis information
- <institution>: the institution for thesis or technical reports
- <publisher>
- <location> publication place, or location of the "publishing" institution
- <editor> for all the sequence of editors
- <note> -> anything else!

Note that for the references (for historical reasons, the goal being to reuse an existing old corpus already annotated like that), all the fields (including the punctuations) must be included under the tags! In case of textual material impossible/hard to annotate, use the tag <note>

* for headers, we try to follow the TEI and we use the following tags: 
- <titlePart> for title (included in a <docTitle> element)
- <docAuthor> for the complete sequence of authors
- <affiliation> for the complete affiliation field
- <address> for the complete address field
- <div type="abstract"> for the abstract block
- <div type="introduction"> for the start of the introduction section (i.e. just after the header ends), alternatives are <div type="intro"> or even <introduction> 
- <keywords> for the keyword field (including possibly the word Keywords:), an additional attribute can give some more information about the type of keywords (PACS, or classes for ACM)
- <email>
- <phone>
- <ptr> for web
- <date> default is the publication date, but the date can be further specified with an attribute for these cases:
- <date type="submission">
- <reference>: this is to annotate the reference information about the current article present in its header
- <idno> for the article-specific identifier, in particular DOI
- <note type="other"> covers by default any other textual material, but the attribute type="" is used for the following cases: 
- <note type="copyright"> for the copyright info - if copyright-char is not recognized correctly by OCR-software, use the Unicode character code &#169; .
- <note type="submission"> for the information about the submission of the document
- <note type="dedication"> 
- <note type="page">
- <note type="english_title">
- <lb/> for line breaks
- <pb/> for page breaks
- <space dim="horizontal"> for tab-stops or other horizontal spaces between content-blocks
