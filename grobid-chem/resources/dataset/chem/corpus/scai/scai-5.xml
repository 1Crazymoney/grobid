        <AbstractText>Serial measurements of antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies in patients with systemic vasculitis. PURPOSE: To assess the value of serial determinations of antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies ( <e id=":::ched|chebi:34507::ched|umls:C0103647:T129:ched|umls:C0004358:T129:ched|chemlist:4276901::ched" b="ched:l:0:4|ched:l:41:1|ched:r:0:5">ANCA</e> ) for monitoring disease activity in patients with systemic vasculitis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-three patients with histologically proven vasculitis (21 with Wegener's granulomatosis, 17 with microscopic polyangiitis, and 5 with renal-limited vasculitis) were studied for a median follow-up of 22 months. Disease activity was prospectively assessed and quantified by the Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score. A total  of 347  sera were analyzed for  <e id="umls:C0103647:T129:ched|:::ched|chebi:34507::ched|umls:C0004358:T129:ched|chemlist:4276901::ched|:::ched" b="ched:l:0:5|ched:l:3:1|ched:r:0:5|ched:r:13:1">ANCA</e>  determination. RESULTS: Relapses occurred in 23 (54%) of 43 patients. Diagnostic category (Wegener's granulomatosis vs micropolyangiitis and renal-limited vasculitis), severity of initial symptoms (mean vasculitis activity score, mean number of organs involved), and  <e id="umls:C0103647:T129:ched|:::ched|umls:C0004358:T129:ched|chemlist:4276901::ched|chebi:34507::ched" b="ched:l:0:5|ched:r:0:5">ANCA</e>  pattern [cytoplasmic- ANCA  (c- ANCA ) vs perinuclear- <e id=":::ched|chemlist:4276901::ched|chebi:34507::ched|umls:C0004358:T129:ched|UMLS:C0103647:T129:ched" b="ched:l:0:2|ched:l:11:3|ched:r:0:4|ched:r:5:1">ANCA</e>  (p- <e id="umls:C0134596:T129:ched|:::ched|umls:C0004358:T129:ched|chemlist:4276901::ched|chebi:34507::ched" b="ched:l:0:2|ched:l:1:2|ched:l:16:1|ched:r:0:5">ANCA</e> )] did not significantly differ between relapsers and nonrelapsers. Lung involvement was more frequent at onset among relapsers [16 of 23 ( ) vs 6 of ( ); P = 0.02]. Relapses were slightly, but not significantly, more frequent in patients with Wegener's granulomatosis or a c- ANCA  pattern. The percentage of relapsers was greater in patients with persistently positive  <e id="chemlist:4276901::ched|chebi:34507::ched|umls:C0103647:T129:ched|umls:C0004358:T129:ched|:::ched" b="ched:l:0:4|ched:l:24:1|ched:r:0:5">ANCA</e>  than in patients with negative or decreasing  ANCA  titers (86% vs , P = 0.0001). However, the predictive value of an increase in  ANCA  titers for the occurrence of a subsequent relapse was only 28% (4 of 14) for c- ANCA , 12% (2 of 17) for anti-proteinase 3- ANCA , and 43% (6 of 14) for anti-myeloperoxidase- ANCA . An increase in  <e id="umls:C0004358:T129:ched|umls:C0103647:T129:ched|chebi:34507::ched|chemlist:4276901::ched|:::ched" b="ched:l:0:4|ched:l:2:1|ched:r:0:5">ANCA</e>  occurred before or during relapse in 33% ( of ) of  cases  for c- ANCA /anti-proteinase 3 antibodies, and 73% (11 of 15) of  cases  for anti-myeloperoxidase antibodies. CONCLUSION: The persistence of  ANCA  positivity is strongly associated with relapses. However, an increase in  ANCA  titers has a poor value for the early prediction of a subsequent relapse and should not be used as a sole parameter for therapeutic intervention. In addition, our results suggest that serial anti-myeloperoxidase determination may be useful as a prognostic marker in patients who are p- ANCA  positive. O</AbstractText>

Leptin concentrations are increased in GH deficient adults even after adjustment for percentage body fat and body fat mass (kg). Although the nature of our data does not allow us to draw any conclusions on the mechanism(s) of increased leptin concentrations in GH deficiency, decreased central sensitivity to leptin and increased leptin production from per unit fat mass, or alterations in leptin clearance, might be operative.

Following metabolism of 2 by rat liver microsomes the predicted formation of 4,4,4-trifluorocrotonaldehyde (5) was confirmed by isolation and identification, by mass spectrometry, of its dinitrophenylhydrazone. The therapeutic indices (LD50-/ID90) for 2 against the ADJ/PC6 mouse tumor and the Walker 256 tumor in the rat were 28.6 and 7.7, respectively, and were lower than the corresponding values for 1 (91.8 and 33.2, respectively) although the toxicities toward Walker cells in a bioassay system of 1 and 2 following microsomal metabolism were similar. In order to study the toxicities of 4 and 5 released under drug metabolizing conditions independently of the production of a toxic  <e id="nci:C62056::ched|ErasmusMC:4349133:T103:ched|chemlist:4275058::ched|umls:C0025033:T109:ched|:::ched|chemlist:4275058::ched|umls:C0025033:T131:ched|ChemList:4275058:T103:ched|:::ched|umls:C1446658:T129:ched|:::ched|umls:C0025033:T121:ched" b="ched:l:0:8|ched:l:8:1|ched:r:0:9">mustard</e>  the analogs 18 [2-(diethylamino)tetrahydro-2H-1,3,<e id="ErasmusMC:4134048:T103:ched|umls:C0030015:T197:ched|UMLS::T103:ched|ChemList:4120432:T103:ched|chemlist:4120432::ched" b="ched:l:0:1|ched:l:27:4|ched:r:0:1|ched:r:6:4">2-oxazaphosphorine</e> 2- <e id="ErasmusMC:4134048:T103:ched|umls:C0030015:T197:ched|chemlist:4277471::ched|ChemList:4120432:T103:ched|UMLS::T103:ched|chemlist:4120432::ched" b="ched:l:0:1|ched:l:1:1|ched:l:18:1|ched:l:45:3|ched:r:0:6">oxide</e> ] and 6 [2-(diethylamino)tetrahydro-6-trifluoromethyl-2H-1,3,2-oxazaphosphorine 2- <e id="ChemList:4178945:T103:ched|chemlist:4277471::ched|UMLS::T103:ched|chebi:50127::ched|chemlist:4178945::ched|ErasmusMC:4215270:T103:ched" b="ched:l:0:1|ched:l:1:1|ched:l:61:3|ched:r:0:5">oxide</e> ] were also synthesized.

        <AbstractText>Involvement of phospholipase  D2  in lysophosphatidate-induced transactivation of platelet-derived growth factor receptor-beta in human bronchial epithelial cells. Lysophosphatidate (LPA) mediates multiple cellular responses  via  heterotrimeric G protein coupled LPA-1, LPA-2, and LPA-3 receptors. Many G protein-coupled receptors stimulate ERK following  tyrosine  phosphorylation of growth factor receptors; however, the mechanism(s) of transactivation of receptor  <e id="ErasmusMC:4354001:T103:ched|chebi:17895::ched|umls:C0041485:T123:ched|chebi:18186::ched|ChemList:4275352:T103:ched|chemlist:4275352::ched|chemlist:4275352::ched|:::ched" b="ched:l:0:6|ched:r:0:6">tyrosine</e>  kinases are not well defined.

These results show for the first time that transactivation of PDGF-R beta by LPAin HBEpCs is regulated by PLD2. O</AbstractText>

        <AbstractText>14591846 Cognitive assessment of geriatric schizophrenic patients with severe impairment. There is evidence that some elderly patients with chronic schizophrenia experience marked impairments in cognitive functioning. Assessment of these patients may be difficult with traditional neuropsychological measures. The purpose of the present study was to determine if cognitive functioning could be validly assessed with the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Late Version Cognitive factor score (ADAS-L Cog) in patients whose scores on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) reflect profound cognitive impairment. Patients with MMSE scores from 0 to were selected from a larger database. Neuropsychological instruments designed for the assessment of mild to moderate dementia were found to be inadequate in this profoundly impaired population, due to floor effects. In contrast, there was a significant relationship between ADAS-L scores and several criterion measures, including the MMSE (R=-.71, P&lt;.001), the Social Adaptive Functions Evaluation (SAFE) social functions scale (R=.47, P&lt;.001), and the negative symptom total score of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) (R=.412, P&lt;.001). The MMSE was somewhat less strongly correlated with both social functions (R=-.401, P&lt;.001) and the negative symptom total score of the PANSS (R=-.366, P&lt;.001). These results suggest that cognition can be reliably and validly assessed with instruments such as the ADAS-L that are designed for the assessment of severely impaired patients. O</AbstractText>

        <AbstractText>1512594 Genetic absence epilepsy in rats from Strasbourg--a review. We have selected a strain of rats and designated it the Genetic Absence Epilepsy Rat from Strasbourg (GAERS). In this strain, of the animals present recurrent generalized non-convulsive seizures characterized by bilateral and synchronous spike-and-wave discharges accompanied with behavioural arrest, staring and sometimes twitching of the vibrissae. Spontaneous SWD (7-11 cps, microV, 0.5-75 sec) start and end abruptly on a normal background EEG. They usually occur at a mean frequency of 1.5 per min when the animals are in a state of quiet wakefulness.

By yeast two-hybrid screening of a mouse embryo library, we have found that a third member of a family of PDZ-containing proteins, membrane associated  guanylate  kinase inverted-3 (MAGI-3), binds to TGFalpha's TVV. MAGI-3 is widely expressed in multiple mouse tissues, including brain. Immunolocalization showed that MAGI-3 and TGFalpha were colocalized in neurons in the cortex and dentate gyrus, as well  as in  ependymal cells and some astrocytes. In vitro, proTGFalpha bound the PDZ-1 domain of MAGI-3 and MAGI-2, but not MAGI-1. MAGI-3 and the 17-kDa cell surface form of proTGFalpha interact transiently in MDCK cells stably transfected with both MAGI-3 and human proTGFalpha cDNAs. MAGI-3 and wild-type proTGFalpha colocalize at the cell surface. In contrast, MAGI-3 forms a stable complex with membrane-fixed TGFalpha early in the secretory pathway and interacts with immature and cell surface forms of membrane-fixed TGFalpha. Overexpression of MAGI-3 resulted in increased levels of TGFalpha in the basolateral medium of polarized MDCK cells, suggesting that MAGI-3 has a role in efficient trafficking of TGFalpha to the cell surface in polarized epithelial cells.

        <AbstractText>16682228 Heterologous expression of lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 in different expression systems. Lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A(2) (Lp- PLA (2)) is a key enzyme involved in atherosclerosis, and has been considered as a new target for drug discovery. The major difficulty for high-throughput screening of Lp- PLA (2) inhibitors and for functional studies was their fast and efficient production. Purification of native Lp- PLA (2) from human plasma was complicated and produced a very low yield. We herein examined the feasibility of expressing and purifying recombinant Lp- PLA (2) in different heterologous expression systems. The fusion Lp- PLA (2) was expressed at high levels and exhibited strong enzyme activity in insect cell-baculovirus expression system. The functional enzyme could also be produced in Pichia pastoris. The inclusion of a Kozak sequence increased greatly the expression level of recombinant Lp- PLA (2) in insect cells, but had little effect on the expression of recombinant Lp- PLA (2)  in P . pastoris and Escherichia coli. P. pastoris-produced Lp- PLA (2) could be purified rapidly and conveniently through a one-step procedure, while baculovirus-produced Lp- PLA (2) could be efficiently purified through a two-step procedure. This ability to readily produce recombinant Lp- PLA (2) could provide a screening model for Lp- PLA (2) inhibitors and will facilitate further studies on this enzyme. O</AbstractText>

The allele frequencies were 0.311 for 2362_2380delAAGAATGGTGTGGGAGAGG, 0.054 for &gt;A, 0.047 for 1852G&gt;T, 0.020 for IVS1+231G&gt;A, 0.014 for IVS9-151A&gt;C, and 0.007 for the other 11 variations. In addition, one known nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphism, 416C&gt;T (T139I), was detected at a 0.007 frequency. Based on the linkage disequilibrium profiles, the region analyzed was divided into three blocks. Haplotype analysis determined/inferred , 16, and 12 haplotypes for block 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Our results on HNF4A variations and haplotypes would be useful for pharmacogenetic studies in Japanese. O</AbstractText>

        <AbstractText>A neural network-based method for risk factor analysis of West Nile virus. There is a lack of knowledge about which risk  factors  are more important in West Nile virus (WNV) transmission and risk magnitude. A better understanding of the risk  factors  is of great help in developing effective new technologies and appropriate prevention strategies for WNV infection. A contribution analysis of all risk  factors  in WNV infection would identify those major risk  factors . Based on the identified major risk  factors , measures to control WNV proliferation could be directed toward those significant risk  factors , thus improving the effectiveness and efficiency in developing WNV control and prevention strategies. Neural networks have many generally accepted  advantages  over conventional analytical techniques, for instance, ability to automatically learn the relationship between the inputs and outputs from training data, powerful generalization ability, and capability of handling nonlinear interactions. In this article, a neural network model was developed for analysis of risk  factors  in WNV infection. To reveal the relative contribution of the input variables, the neural network was trained using an algorithm called structural learning with forgetting. During the learning, weak neural connections are forced to fade away while a skeletal network with strong connections emerges. The significant risk  factors  can be identified by analyzing this skeletal network. The proposed approach is tested with the dead bird surveillance data in Ontario, Canada. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. O</AbstractText>

        <AbstractText>Implied preference for seismic design level and earthquake insurance. Seismic risk can be reduced by implementing newly developed seismic provisions in design codes. Furthermore, financial protection or enhanced utility and happiness for stakeholders could be gained through the purchase of earthquake insurance. If this is not so, there would be no market for such insurance. However, perceived benefit associated with insurance is not universally shared by stakeholders partly due to their diverse risk attitudes. This study investigates the implied seismic design preference with insurance options for decisionmakers of bounded rationality whose preferences could be adequately represented by the cumulative prospect theory ( CPT ). The investigation is focused on assessing the sensitivity of the implied seismic design preference with insurance options to model parameters of the  CPT  and to fair and unfair insurance arrangements. Numerical results suggest that human cognitive limitation and risk perception can affect the implied seismic design preference by the  CPT  significantly. The mandatory purchase of fair insurance will lead the implied seismic design preference to the optimum design level that is dictated by the minimum expected lifecycle cost rule. Unfair insurance decreases the expected gain as well as its associated variability, which is preferred by risk-averse decisionmakers. The obtained results of the implied preference for the combination of the seismic design level and insurance option suggest that property owners, financial institutions, and municipalities can take advantage of affordable insurance to establish successful seismic risk management strategies.

        <AbstractText>Households ' perceived personal risk and responses in a multihazard environment. This study proposed and tested a multistage model of household response to three hazards-flood, hurricane, and toxic chemical release-in Harris County Texas. The model, which extends Lindell and Perry's (1992, ) Protective Action Decision Model, proposed a basic causal chain from hazard proximity through hazard experience and perceived personal risk to expectations of continued residence in the home and adoption of household hazard adjustments. Data from 321 households generally supported the model, but the mediating effects of hazard experience and perceived personal risk were partial rather than complete. In addition, the data suggested that four demographic variables-gender, age, income, and ethnicity-affect the basic causal chain at different points. O</AbstractText>

This review analyzes prospects for optimization of PDT for the management of dermatoses with defects in keratinocyte proliferation/differentiation, and discusses the use of differentiating agents that redirect metabolic utilization within cells and lead to high levels of PS accumulation.

        <AbstractText>Distinct cognitive profiles and rates of decline on the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale in autopsy-confirmed frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer's disease. Neuropsychological studies have shown that patients with Frontotemporal dementia ( FTD ) perform worse than patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) on tests of conceptualization and verbal fluency, but better on tests of memory and visuospatial functions. However, it is not known if these distinct cognitive profiles are robust enough to be detected using a relatively brief dementia screening instrument such as the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale (MDRS). To address this issue, the MDRS subscale profiles of patients with autopsy-confirmed  FTD  (n = 17) or AD (n = 34) were compared. Results showed distinct cognitive profiles in which  FTD  patients performed worse than AD patients on the Initiation/Perseveration and Conceptualization subscales while performing better on the Memory and Construction subscales. The distinct subscale profiles correctly classified 85% of AD patients and 76% of  FTD  patients. Profiles were maintained in a subset of mildly-to-moderately demented patients (MDRS &gt; or = ) and correctly classified 89% of these patients. In addition,  FTD  patients (mean = points/year) declined faster than AD patients (mean = 14.8 points/year) on MDRS total and specific subscale scores. These results suggest that the MDRS may be a useful adjunct to other clinical measures for distinguishing  FTD  from AD and tracking the progression of the disorder. O</AbstractText>

        <AbstractText>Thalamic atrophy and cognition in unilateral temporal lobe epilepsy. This study examined quantitative magnetic resonance volumes of the thalamus and hippocampus and determined their relationship with cognitive function and clinical seizure characteristics in a sample of 46 unilateral temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) subjects ( left and 26 right) and 29 controls. The hippocampus and thalamus exhibited different patterns of volume abnormality, different associations with clinical seizure characteristics, and different patterns of relationship with cognitive measures. Hippocampal volume reduction was primarily ipsilateral to the seizure focus, and thalamic volume reduction was bilateral. Ipsilateral hippocampal volume was significantly correlated with both early neurodevelopmental features (age of seizure onset) and disease characteristics (duration of epilepsy), whereas thalamus integrity was related only to disease variables. Hippocampal volume showed a selective association with verbal memory performance. In contrast, both left and right thalamic volumes were significantly correlated with performance on both memory and nonmemory cognitive domains. These findings underscore the importance of thalamic atrophy in chronic TLE and its potential implications for cognition. O</AbstractText>

        <AbstractText>Quantitative magnetic resonance image analysis of the cerebellum in macrocephalic and normocephalic children and adults with autism. A detailed morphometric analysis of the cerebellum in autism with and without macrocephaly. Four subject groups (N = 65; male; IQs &gt; or = 65; age 7 to 26 years) were studied with quantitative MRI; normocephalic and macrocephalic individuals with autism without mental retardation were compared to normocephalic and benign macrocephalic typically developing individuals. Total cerebellum volumes and surface areas of four lobular midsagittal groups were measured. Independent t-tests between autism and control subjects matched for head size revealed no significant differences. Multivariate analyses of variance were also performed, using the diagnostic group as the fixed factor, cerebellar measures as the dependent variables and total intracranial volume, total brain volume, age, verbal IQ, and performance IQ as covariates. No significant differences were found; however, a trend was noted in which macrocephalic individuals with autism consistently exhibited slightly smaller cerebellar volume or surface area when compared to individuals with benign macrocephaly. In autism, with and without macrocephaly, cerebellar structures were found to be proportional to head size and did not differ from typically developing subjects. O</AbstractText>

        <AbstractText>Frequency and  bases  of abnormal performance by healthy adults on neuropsychological testing. The frequency and determinants of abnormal test performance by normal individuals are critically important to clinical inference. Here we compare two approaches to predicting rates of abnormal test performance among healthy individuals with the rates actually shown by 327 neurologically normal adults aged 18-92 years. We counted how many participants produced abnormal scores, defined by three different cutoffs with test batteries of varied length, and the number of abnormal scores they produced. Observed rates generally were closer to predictions based on a series of Monte Carlo simulations than on the binomial model. They increased with the number of tests administered, decreased as more stringent cutoffs were used to identify abnormality, varied with the degree of correlation among test scores, and depended on individual differences in age, education, race, sex, and estimated premorbid IQ. Adjusting scores for demographic variables and premorbid IQ did not reduce rates of abnormal performance. However, it eliminated the contribution of these variables to rates of abnormal test performance. These findings raise fundamental questions about the nature and interpretation of abnormal test performance by normal, healthy adults. O</AbstractText>

        <AbstractText>Visual perception in prediagnostic and early stage Huntington's disease. Disturbances of visual perception frequently accompany neurodegenerative disorders but have been little studied in Huntington's disease (HD) gene carriers. We used psychophysical tests to assess visual perception among individuals in the prediagnostic and early stages of HD. The sample comprised four groups, which included nongene carriers (NG), 32 prediagnostic gene carriers with minimal neurological abnormalities (PD1); prediagnostic gene carriers with moderate neurological abnormalities (PD2), and 36 gene carriers with diagnosed HD. Contrast sensitivity for stationary and moving sinusoidal gratings, and tests of form and motion discrimination, were used to probe different visual pathways. Patients with HD showed impaired contrast sensitivity for moving gratings. For one of the three contrast sensitivity tests, the prediagnostic gene carriers with greater neurological abnormality (PD2) also had impaired performance as compared with NG. These findings suggest that early stage HD disrupts visual functions associated with the magnocellular pathway. However, these changes are only observed in individuals diagnosed with HD or who are in the more symptomatic stages of prediagnostic HD. O</AbstractText>

Congenital TB is rare, with most neonates and young infants becoming infected after birth. The incidence of neonatal TB might increase in industrialised countries as a result of immigration from countries with higher TB incidence among women of childbearing age. We report two  cases  of post-natally acquired pulmonary TB in newborns who developed marked lung destruction, a complication of TB which has seldom been described in the first month of life. A high index of clinical suspicion is required when evaluating pregnant women at risk for TB and their ill children, as early identification and treatment can prevent the devastating consequences of TB.

        <AbstractText>Worker size in the formosan subterranean termite in relation to colony breeding structure as inferred from molecular markers. The Formosan subterranean termite, Coptotermes formosanus Shiraki, is an invasive species that originated in China and has been introduced to Hawaii and the U.S. mainland. Colonies are headed either by a pair of reproductives (simple families) or by varying numbers of inbreeding reproductives (extended families), and therefore have variable degrees of inbreeding. Worker size also varies among colonies of Formosan termites. We tested whether variation in worker size can be explained by the breeding system. Workers were collected from colonies from three geographically separated populations (China, Hawaii, and Louisiana), and body weight and head size were measured. Microsatellite genotyping was used to establish whether colonies were simple or extended families and to determine the heterozygosity of workers and their degree of inbreeding relative to their colony (F (IC), sensitive to the number of reproductives). All Chinese colonies contained multiple inbreeding neotenics. In Hawaii, 37% of the colonies were simple families and 63% were extended families, both having considerable degrees of inbreeding. In Louisiana, 57% of the colonies were simple families, which were mostly headed by unrelated pairs, and 43% were extended families. In simple families, size and body weight of workers were not associated with F (IC) or heterozygosity. In extended families of two populations, both size parameters were negatively correlated with F (IC); however, heterozygosity was not associated with worker size in any of the populations. This suggests that the number of reproductives within colonies has a stronger influence on worker size than the individuals' genetic diversity in Formosan subterranean termite colonies.

Don) Lindl.] and Tsuga heterophylla [(Raf.) Sarg] tree species across five elevational sites, we collected branch tips and foliose/crustose lichen samples over three time periods. Thirty-three species of oribatid mites were identified from the study area. Mite species richness and abundance was significantly affected by microhabitat, and this association was independent of sampling time. At the microhabitat scale, distinct species assemblages were associated with lichen and branch tip habitats, and to a lesser degree, tree species. Conifer specificity was most apparent in the closely related species of Jugatala, where Jugatala tuberosa Ewing was only found on branch tips from A. amabilis and Jugatala sp. was primarily found on branch tips from T. heterophylla. Microhabitat specificity was most pronounced in Dendrozetes sp. where most individuals were found on branch tips and Anachiperia geminus Lindo et al. that occurred primarily on lichens. Principal components analysis of oribatid mite community composition further showed a high degree of association with microhabitat and tree species.

        <AbstractText>Photodynamic diagnostics of bladder tumors. Approximately 18,000 new  cases  of urothelial cancer of the bladder occur annually, making it the most frequent urogenital neoplasia representing nearly 4% of all malignomas. Tumor stage defines two subgroups requiring specific therapeutic approaches and implying distinct prognoses. Non-muscle-invasive urothelial cancer recurs frequently and occasionally progresses to muscle-invasive stages. Remnant tumor after initial resection is seen as one major factor in high recurrence rates. Although photodynamic diagnostics improving detection and increasing recurrence-free survival has been introduced to broad application, it has yet not been established as standard procedure.

        <AbstractText>An exploratory evaluation of the contribution of personality and childhood sexual victimization to the development of sexually abusive behavior. Scores on the Millon Adolescent Clinical Inventory (MACI) and the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) were collected from two samples of incarcerated delinquent males: 74 adjudicated sexual abusers and 53 nonsexual abusers. In comparison to non-sexually abusive youths, a larger percentage of the sexually abusive youths indicated a history of childhood sexual victimization. The scores were then entered into a logistic regression to assess the contribution of personality characteristics to a social learning "victim-to-victimizer" etiological model. After controlling for time in treatment, the model correctly classified 76.6% of the youths. The variables that contributed significantly to the social learning model were the CTQ Sexual Abuse and Physical Neglect scales and the Submissive and Forceful scales on the MACI. Research and treatment implications of these findings are discussed. O</AbstractText>

Next, the user specifies measurement conditions and checks the diffraction images  via  the Internet. The user can also collect diffraction data using an automated sample changer robot and beamline control software. For distant users there is a newly developed data management system, D-Cha. D-Cha provides a graphical user interface that enables the user to specify the experimental conditions for samples and to check and download the diffraction images using a web browser.

The high-brilliance beam, derived from the new short-gap undulator (SGU#17), allows for unique protein crystallographic experiments such as data collection from microcrystals and structural determination using softer X-rays. However, microcrystal experiments require robust beam stability during data collection and minor fluctuations could not be ignored. Initially, significant beam instability was observed at BL-17A. The causes of the beam instability were investigated and its various sources identified. Subsequently, several effective countermeasures have been implemented, and the fluctuation of the beam intensity successfully suppressed to within 1%. Here the instability reduction techniques used at BL-17A are presented. O</AbstractText>

        <AbstractText>Implementation of remote monitoring and diffraction evaluation systems at the Photon Factory macromolecular crystallography beamlines. Owing to recent  advances  in high-throughput technology in macromolecular crystallography beamlines, such as high-brilliant X-ray sources, high-speed readout detectors and robotics, the number of samples that can be examined in a single visit to the beamline has increased dramatically. In order to make these experiments more efficient, two functions, remote monitoring and diffraction image evaluation, have been implemented in the macromolecular crystallography beamlines at the Photon Factory (PF). Remote monitoring allows scientists to participate in the experiment by watching from their laboratories, without having to come to the beamline. Diffraction image evaluation makes experiments easier, especially when using the sample exchange robot. To implement these two functions, two independent clients have been developed that work specifically for remote monitoring and diffraction image evaluation. In the macromolecular crystallography beamlines at PF, beamline control is performed using STARS (simple transmission and retrieval system). The system adopts a client-server style in which client programs communicate with each other through a server process using the STARS protocol. This is an advantage of the extension of the system; implementation of these new functions required few modifications of the existing system. O</AbstractText>

The distances between the 2 groups were significantly higher than those within each group at weeks 4 and 8. Mice in the 2 groups formed clusters at weeks 2 and 3 respectively, and mice were divided into 2 clusters by their respective groups at weeks 4 and 8.

The OLETF rat is a well-established model for the study of type 2 diabetes associated with obesity and has been shown to possess multiple hyperglycemic alleles in its genome. Here we focused on and carefully characterized one of the previously reported congenic strains, F.O-Nidd3/of that  carries  the OLETF allele of the Nidd3/of locus (also known as Niddm21 in the Rat Genome Database) in the normoglycemic F344 genetic background. A prominent finding was that the  F1  progeny between the congenic and the F344 stain, whose genotype is heterozygote at the Nidd3/of locus, showed mild hyperglycemia equal to the parental congenic rat, suggesting that the OLETF allele is dominant. To our knowledge, this is the first study in which a diabetic QTL has been directly demonstrated to be dominant by using congenic strains. O</AbstractText>

His hearing disturbance improved gradually, however, dysarthria, right-sided facial weakness and dysesthesia, and gait disturbance was developed 11 days after the onset of hearing disturbance. MR imaging revealed fresh infarctions of the right dorsolateral pons and middle cerebellar peduncle localized in the territory of anterior inferior cerebellar artery. Unilateral hearing disturbance could be an isolated manifestation prior to ipsilateral anterior inferior cerebellar artery infarction. O</AbstractText>

        <AbstractText>Protease production by different thermophilic fungi. A comparative study was carried out to evaluate protease production in solid-state fermentation (SSF) and submerged fermentation (SmF) by nine different thermophilic fungi - Thermoascus aurantiacus Miehe, Thermomyces lanuginosus, T. lanuginosus TO.03, Aspergillus flavus 1.2, Aspergillus sp. 13.33, Aspergillus sp. 13.34, Aspergillus sp. 13.35, Rhizomucor pusillus 13.36 and Rhizomucor sp. 13.37 - using substrates containing proteins to induce enzyme secretion. Soybean extract (soybean milk), soybean flour, milk powder, rice, and wheat bran were tested. The most satisfactory results were obtained when using wheat bran in SSF. The fungi that stood out in SSF were T. lanuginosus, T. lanuginosus TO.03, Aspergillus sp. 13.34, Aspergillus sp. 13.35, and Rhizomucor sp. 13.37, and those in SmF were T. aurantiacus, T. lanuginosus TO.03, and 13.37. In both fermentation systems, A. flavus 1.2 and R. pusillus 13.36 presented the lowest levels of proteolytic activity. O</AbstractText>

        <AbstractText>Involvement of the incudostapedial joint anomaly in conductive deafness. Conclusion. The outcome of surgery depends on complexities of middle ear anomalies and definite diagnosis can only be achieved during exploratory tympanotomy. We must be aware that the pathology of the congenital ossicular anomalies is variable and careful surgery is needed for hearing improvement. Objective. This study aimed to investigate congenital ossicular malformation. Subjects and methods. Fifteen  cases  of ossicular anomalies without external ear malformation were studied. The anomaly of the incus-stapes complex was the most frequent. There were two  cases  of fused incudostapedial (IS) joint, which is an extremely rare occurrence.  Case  1 was a 33-year-old man, in whom otosclerosis was suspected and exploratory tympanotomy was performed. The IS joint was fused, and the stapes was immobile. Small fenestra stapedectomy was performed. In  case  2, a 52-year-old woman, otosclerosis was also suspected and exploratory tympanotomy was performed. The IS joint was fused and the incus was fixed. After the long process of the incus was cut, the stapes became mobile. However, since the incus remained immobile, it was removed and was placed on the stapes. In both  cases , the hearing improved after surgery. The averaged hearing gain of 15 cases was 28.8 dB. O</AbstractText>

        <AbstractText>Tinnitus and brain MRI findings in Japanese elderly. Conclusion. There is evidence of an inverse association between cerebral infarction and tinnitus in this study. The effects of cerebral infarction on tinnitus could be explained by a neurophysiological model of tinnitus. Objectives. We examined the relationship between tinnitus and brain MRI findings including cerebral infarction, brain atrophy, ventricular dilatation, and white matter lesions. Subjects and methods. This was a cross-sectional population-based study of 2193 subjects aged 41-82 years living in Aichi prefecture, Japan. Detailed questionnaires, pure tone audiometry, and brain MRI were performed. Results. After adjusting for potential confounders in a multiple logistic analysis, cerebral infarction was inversely associated with tinnitus (odds ratio (OR)=0.649, 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.477-0.884). Cerebral infarctions of the basal ganglia (OR=0.542), thalamus (OR=0.441), and pons (OR=0.319) were especially associated with tinnitus. Brain atrophy, ventricular dilatation, and white matter lesions had no significant effects on the prevalence of tinnitus. O</AbstractText>

        <AbstractText>Combination of Bernouilli effect producing maneuver-induced pharyngeal narrowing rate with body mass index as predictive tool for obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. Conclusions. It is suggested that the combination of the pharyngeal narrowing rate during the Bernouilli effect producing maneuver (BEPM) with the body mass index (BMI) might be a promising predictive method for obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). Objectives. An attempt was made to clarify the possibility that the dynamic narrowing of the pharynx evaluated by nasopharyngoscopy with BEPM, a forced inspiration through the nose with the mouth closed, might be a reliable clinical daytime predictor for identifying patients at risk of developing OSAS. Subjects and methods. Subjects were 57 patients complaining of snoring and sleepiness during daytime. Endoscopic images of the retropalatal pharynx were obtained and their area was measured by NIH imaging. The pharyngeal narrowing rate during quiet  nasal  breathing and that during BEPM were compared to assess pharyngeal dynamics. To increase the sensitivity of this method, BMI was added to the pharyngeal narrowing rate during BEPM. Results. The criterion of BEPM at a cut-off value of with BMI at a cut-off value of 25 kg/m(2) achieved a sensitivity of 93%, while the specificity was 67% in differentiating simple snorers from OSAS patients (apnea index &gt;5). In addition, the likelihood ratio of the method was found to be 2.81. O</AbstractText>

Single cell clones isolated from the  HO -1 cell line varied in their sensitivity to the antiproliferative effects of IFN-delta and  MEZ . With all twelve clones, however, the combination of IFN-delta plus  MEZ  was more growth inhibitory than either agent used alone, even in  HO -1 subclones displaying relative resistance to IFN-delta. By continuous growth in gradually increasing concentrations of IFN-delta, a variant population of  HO -1 cells,  HO -1 delta R-D, was generated which was more resistant to the antigrowth effects of IFN-delta than the original  HO -1 parental cell line. In the IFN delta R-D cell line the combination of IFN-delta plus  MEZ  synergistically suppressed growth. Exposure of  HO -1 cells to units/ml IFN-delta or ng/ml  MEZ  for 96 hr resulted in no change or an increase in the binding of labelled  IFN-gamma  to surface receptors, whereas the combination of IFN-delta plus  MEZ  increased  IFN-gamma  binding 2-to-4-fold in  HO -1 cells. This increase was the result of an increase in the number of receptors on treated cells coupled with a protection against a decrease in receptors observed for confluent untreated cells. Changes in  IFN-gamma  binding resulting from treatment with IFN-delta plus  MEZ  were not associated with alterations in the binding affinity of  INF -gamma to its receptor. Changes were also observed in the expression of HLA Class I <e id=":::ched|:::ched|chebi:59132::ched|:::ched|nci:C268::ched|umls:C0019629:T129:ched|umls:C0008897:T109:ched|umls:C0008897:T129:ched" b="ched:l:0:4|ched:l:6:1|ched:l:11:1|ched:r:0:6">antigens</e> and MAAs following treatment of  HO -1 cells with IFN-delta,  MEZ  or IFN-delta plus  MEZ .

        <AbstractText>Conversion of the 8-phenolic 1,2,3,4,5,6-hexahydro-2,6-methano-3-benzazocines to the corresponding 8-thiophenolic analogues was achieved by three different routes. Diazotization of 8-amino-2,6-methano-3-benzazocine (2) followed by the reaction with CH3SNa afforded 8-( methylthio )-1,2,3,4,5,6-hexahydro-2,6-methano-3-benzazocine (3). Another route using Grewe cyclization was also examined for the synthesis of 3. As the most effective route, Newman-Kwart rearrangement of benzazocines was selected and closely investigated. 8-(N,N-Dimethylthiocarbamoyl)oxy derivatives (6a-e) rearranged to 8-(N,N-dimethylcarbamoyl)thio derivatives (7a-e) in good yields. Reductive cleavage of 7a-e and subsequent methylation or acylations gave the title compounds (3, 8-24).

        <AbstractText>The determination of the structure and function of the sigma receptor subtypes and their physiological role(s) has been impeded by the unavailability of selective ligands.

Incorporation of substituted  (E) -8-benzylidene moieties onto the 7-keto precursor of (+)-2- methyl -5-(3-hydroxyphenyl)morphan, (+)-1, produces compounds (-)-2 through (-)-7 (5.8-32.0 nM, sigma 1), which have between a 25- and 131-fold increase in affinity for the sigma 1 receptor subtype relative to the keto precursor (+)-1 (Ki = 762 nM, sigma 1). Compound (-)-2 is the most selective of this group (16-fold) for the sigma 1 subtype versus sigma 2. Substitution of an  (E) -8-benzylidenemoiety onto the 7-keto precursor of (-)-2- methyl -5-(3-hydroxyphenyl)morphan, (-)-1, produces compounds (+)-2-(+)-9 (6.4-52.6 nM, sigma 2), which have at least a 475-3906-fold increase in affinity for the sigma 2 receptor subtype relative to the keto precursor (-)-1 (Ki = 25 x (3) nM). This enhancement of sigma 2 receptor affinity is accompanied by substantial selectivity of all of these dextrorotatory products for the sigma 2 relative to the sigma 1 subtype (32-238-fold), and thus, they are among the most sigma 2 selective compounds currently known. Furthermore, the sigma 1 subtype is highly enantioselective for the levorotatory isomers, (-)-2-(-)-7 (41-1034-fold), whereas the sigma 2 subtype is only somewhat enantioselective for the dextrorotatory isomers, (+)-2-(+)-7 (2.6-9.3-fold). All of these derivatives retain substantial affinity for the mu opioid receptor. Despite the high affinity of the dextrorotatory derivatives for the mu opioid receptor, the high affinity and selectivity for sigma 2 over sigma 1 sites will surely prove beneficial as tools for the delineation of the function and physiological role of sigma 2 receptors.

The object of the study was to determine the structural  factors  governing sigma 1/sigma 2 affinity and selectivity within this class of compounds. TheN -substituent in spiro[ isobenzofuran -1( 3H ),4'- piperidines ] is highly important, both for affinity and selectivity. Spiropiperidines with no or small N-substituents (H, Me, Et) exert very low affinity for both sigma 1 and sigma 2 binding sites (IC50(sigma 1, sigma 2) &amp;gt; nM), whereas medium-sized substituents (e.g., Pr, Bu, Ph( CH2 )2) result in potent, but unselective compounds (IC50(sigma 1, sigma 2) = 2-5 nM). Increasing the chain length and the lipophilicity of the N-substituent result in compounds in which high affinity for sigma 2 binding sites is retained and with selectivity for sigma 2 vs sigma 1 binding sites (e.g., 4-cyclohexyl-1-butyl: IC50-(sigma 1) = 1.5 nM, IC50(sigma 2) = 0.07 nM).

Compounds with substituents (F, CF3) in the 4- or 7-position of the  isobenzofuran  display high affinity for sigma 2 binding sites (IC50(sigma 2) = 0.5-2 nM) and very low affinity for sigma 1 binding sites (IC50(sigma 1) &amp;gt; nM).

        <AbstractText>XBMP -1B (Xtld), a Xenopus homolog of dorso-ventral polarity gene in Drosophila, modifies tissue phenotypes of ventral explants.

XBMP-1B protein has an additional copy of an  EGF -like sequence followed by two copies of complement 1 r/s repeat in the C-terminus. The overall protein structure predicted from the XBMP-1B sequence reveals that it encodes a protein homologous to Drosophila tolloid. Three XBMP-1 transcripts (2.9, 5.2 and 6.6 kb) were detected by northern blot analysis. However, the 2.9 kb transcript hybridized specifically with XBMP-1A and the 5.2 and 6.6 kb transcripts hybridized with XBMP-1B. In Drosophila, a major function of tolloid is to augment the activity of the decapentaplegic gene product, a close relative of tumor growth factor (TGF)-beta superfamily members,  BMP -2/4. Although XBMP-1 and XBMP-4 are detected in various adult tissues of Xenopus, the expression pattern of these two genes was not tightly correlated. In the embryo, the expression of XBMP-1 increased gradually from the morula to the swimming tadpole stages. Injection of XBMP-1B <e id="umls:C0035668:T114:ched|:::ched|:::ched|UMLS:C0035668:T114:ched|umls:C0035668:T114:ched|:::ched" b="ched:l:0:5|ched:l:8:1|ched:r:0:6">RNA</e> into the ventral blastomeres at the 4-cell stage caused an elongation of the ventral marginal zone explants and converted  <e id="umls:C0017645:T123:ched|ErasmusMC:4330933:T103:ched|chemlist:4249367::ched|chemlist:4249367::ched|chebi:5386::ched|ChemList:4249367:T103:ched" b="ched:l:0:4|ched:l:9:1|ched:r:0:3|ched:r:18:1|ched:r:8:1">globin</e> -positive blood cells to mesenchymal and muscle tissues at later stages. It was shown that XBMP-1A was less active and a 1A mutant lacking the signal sequence was inactive.
