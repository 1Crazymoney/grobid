# General principles

The annotation guidelines describes the rules to follow for creating additional training dat to be used with GROBID.

## Generating pre-annotated training data

The addition of training in GROBID is NOT done from scratch, but from pre-annotated training data generated by the existing models in GROBID. This ensures that the syntax of the new training data will be (normally) correct and that the stream of text will be easy to align with the text extracted from the PDF. This permits also to take advantage of the existing models which will annotate correctly a certain amoung of text, and to focus on the corrections, improving the productivity of the annotator.

For generating pre-annotated training files for GROBID based on the existing models, see the instructions for running the software in batch [here](../Training-the-models-of-Grobid/#generation-of-training-data) and [here](../Grobid-batch/#createtraining).

After running the batch `createTraining` on a set of PDF files using methods for creating training data, each article comes with:

* the PDF used to generate the training data, for instance `toto.pdf`,

* a set of pre-annotated files with extension `*.training.*.tei.xml` for the different GROBID models: e.g. `toto.training.header.tei.xml` for the pre-annotated header section, `toto.training.fulltext.tei.xml` for the pre-annotated body section (so-called fulltext model), etc. __these files need to be edited and corrected__ in order to get "gold-standard" training data to be used by GROBID,

* a set of files without xml extension, giving the list of tokens with associated features to used for training: e.g. `toto.training.header` for header model, `toto.training.fulltext` for the fulltext model - __these files can be ignored and should not be edited__, but are necessary for training Grobid.

The extact list of generated files depends on the strutures occurring in the article. The following training files to be corrected are typically produced:

* a pre-annotated file for the segmentation model - the primary model used to segment a complete article into the zones: `toto.training.segmentation.tei.xml`,
* a pre-annotated file for the header model: `toto.training.header.tei.xml`,
* a pre-annotated file for the detailed affiliation and address recognition: `toto.training.header.affiliation.tei.xml`,
* a pre-annotated file for the detailed authors recognition in the header: `toto.training.header.authors.tei.xml`,
* a pre-annotated file for the detailed structure of dates appearing in the header: `toto.training.header.date.xml`.
* a pre-annotated file for the detailed bibliographical reference segment structure if one appears in the header: `toto.training.header-references.xml`,
* a pre-annotated file for the structured body: `toto.training.fulltext.tei.xml`
* pre-annotated files for the different figures and tables: `toto.training.figure.tei.xml` and `toto.training.table.tei.xml`,
* a pre-annotated file for the `reference-segmenter` model (segment a bibliographical section into individual reference entries): `toto.training.references.referenceSegmenter.tei.xml`,
* a pre-annotated file for all the bibliographical references of the article: `toto.training.references.tei.xml`,
* a pre-annotated file for all the authors appearing in the bibliographical references of the article: `toto.training.references.authors.tei.xml`.

These files must be reviewed and corrected manually before being added to the training data, taking into account that exploiting any additional training data requires GROBID to re-create its models - by [retraining](../Training-the-models-of-Grobid) them. 

## Correcting pre-annotated files

The most important principle when correcting the pre-annotated training data is to __keep the stream of text untouched__. Only the tags can be moved, the text itself shall not be modified or corrected. The stream of text present in the training file after extraction of the content of the PDF, is similar to the stream of text GROBID will have to processed once the models created. It is thus important to have GROBID trained on these realistic input, even if they contain OCR errors, noise, unknown unicode characters, etc.   

There are two exceptions to this main rule :

* actual __end-of-lines__ from the PDF files are indicated by element `<lb/>`. These tags `<lb/>` should be considered as part of the stream of text are should not be moved or removed with respect to the overall text stream. 

* in the TEI/XML files, end-of-line is equivalent to a space character - it is thus possible to add or remove end-of-line characters as long the spacing is preserved.
For instance for GROBID:

```xml
 	<title level="a">In XML training files, end-of-line and space are the same</title> <lb/> <author>Kermitt Jr</author> <lb/> <date>2017</date> 
```

is equivalent to 

```xml
<title level="a">In XML training files, end-of-line and space are 
	the same</title> <lb/> 
	<author>Kermitt Jr</author> 
	<lb/> 
	
	<date>2017</date> 
```

In the standard Grobid installation, examples of existing annotations can be found under `grobid-trainer/resources/` for each model.

In the current correction process, no xml file shall be added: 

* if an XML file is incorrectly produced, e.g. `toto.training.header-references.xml` is produced while a chunk of text was incorrectly identified as reference in the header file, then the XML file must be removed,

* if an XML file is missing, e.g. a chunk of text was a reference but was pre-annotated automatically by Grobid as a note, then the additional XML file `toto.training.header-references.xml` shall not be created. 

XML files are therefore either modified or deleted, but never created. 

In the next sections, the annotation guidelines for each model are presented with various examples.
